## Etymology

"Bitachon" finds its roots in the Hebrew word "בטח;" something definitive.

## The Levels of Bitachon

There are three distinct levels of Bitachon:[^1]

1. __The First Level:__ At this stage, one clings to something — anything, even if there's just a shadow of hope. In this case, the term "Tikvah" (Hope) is more appropriate. Bitachon, however, comes into play when there isn't even a shadow of hope, leading us to the second level.
2. __The Second Level:__ In situations that seem impossible, individuals may feel intense worry, yet they still maintain Bitachon. However, this level doesn't signify complete trust in [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]], as taught by The Baal Shem Tov.
3. __The Third Level:__ Here, one remains calm and steady even when facing unfavorable circumstances. Doing what they have to do, without a shadow of a doubt that [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] will help.
