## Etymology

The word Sefirah (ספירה) is associated with many words in Lashon Hakodesh, which can help clarify the function of the Sefiros. The words below are in no particular order:
1. Mispar (מספר): Meaning "number" or "counting."
2. Sefer (ספר): Meaning "book," which follows a well-defined structure.
3. Lesaper (לספר): Meaning "to express" or "to communicate," signifying that the function of a Sefirah is to express a certain attribute.
4. Sifiras Hadevarim (ספירת הדברים): Meaning "inventory of the actions."
5. Sapir (ספיר): A brilliant and illuminating gemstone, signifying that a Sefirah's function is to give light.
6. Sipur (סיפור): Meaning "story," signifying the unfolding story of creation – past, present, and future.

## Definitions

The Sefiros are the building blocks by which [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] creates the world. They are used to transfer "Energy" from a higher level to a lower one.

The Sefiros are ten spheres or classes,[^1] in the following order: [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], [[Binah - בינה|Binah]], [[Da'as - דעת|Da'as]], [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]] [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]], [[Tiferes - תפארת|Tiferes]], [[Netzach - נצח|Netzach]], [[Hod - הוד|Hod]], [[Yesod - יסוד|Yesod]], & [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]].

In some schemes [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] is omitted from the order of the ten Sefiros for reasons to be explained further on; these schemes take [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] as the first of the ten and insert [[Da'as - דעת|Da'as]] as a Sefirah after [[Binah - בינה|Binah]].

When the Sefiros are mentioned in Chassidus without context, it is generally referring to the Sefiros of [[Atzilus - אצילות|Atzilus]].

## Grouping The Sefiros

The Sefiros can be arranged in two manners. One as in one line of ten, one under the other, from [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] through [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]]. The other in three columns of three, with [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] below in the center.

In this order, the Sefiros are divided in six ways: three on the horizontal axis and three on the vertical axis.[^2]

##### The Three Horizontal Levels Are:

1. [[Chabad - חב״ד|Chabad]] (חב״ד)
2. [[ChaGaS - חג''ת|ChaGaS]] (חג״ת)
3. [[NeHY - נה״י|NeHY]] (נה״י)

The Sefiros emanate from above downward, focusing on their relative ethereality, closeness to the [[Ein Sof - אין סוף|Ein Sof]], and distance from the worlds. This sequence corresponds to the human body: the head ([[Chabad - חב״ד|Chabad]]), the torso ([[ChaGaS - חג''ת|ChaGaS]]), and the legs ([[NeHY - נה״י|NeHY]]).

##### The Three Vertical Levels Are:

1. [[ChaChaN - חח״ן|ChaChaN]] (חח״ן) on the right
2. [[BaGaH - בג״ה|BaGaH]] (בג״ה) on the left
3. [[DaTY - דת״י|DaTY]] (דת״י) in the center

When looking at the Sefiros from right to left on the vertical axis, we can see a gradient that emphasizes their general thrust, ranging from revelation and creative outflow on the right to concealment, severity, and withholding on the left.[^3][^4]
