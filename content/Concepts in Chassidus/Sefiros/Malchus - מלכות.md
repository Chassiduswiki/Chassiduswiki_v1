## Etymology

Kingship or sovereignty is more akin to a condition or function, as a king can only reign if there are subjects willing to be subservient and obey his commands.[^1]

Malchus is unique among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]].[^2] It is the last and "lowest level" of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], and does not exert any influence of its own except that "which the other [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] pour into it."[^3] In other words, Malchus can only "reign" when there are subjects willing to be subservient, so to speak.

## Definitions

The tenth and last of the ten [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], Malchus represents the quality of transcendence and distance, as a King who is at once distant and in need of "subjects willing to be subservient." This is described with the example of a title or name.[^4] A name exists only to relate to others. When a person is alone, there is no need for a name.

### Malchus in the Process of Creation

Malchus is the source that creates and maintains the worlds, as is written, "Malchuscha (Your kingdom) is the Malchus (kingdom) of all Worlds."[^5] The root of the existence of all worlds is from Malchus.[^6]

The fact that the worlds are actually brought into being by G-d's speech is because of the exalted quality possessed by Malchus. Thus, the essential power for Creation stems from the exaltedness of Malchus, and it is with this power that all matter  is brought into  existence by way of  G-d's speech.

[^3]: See Eitz Chaim 6:5, 8:5, which speaks of Malchus as "an [[Aspaklaria - אספקלריא|Aspaklaria]] ([[Aspaklaria - אספקלריא|אספקלריא]]), because it has no light of its own." The Zohar I:249b, 251b, therefore compares Malchus to "the moon that has no light of its own save that which is given to it from the sun."
