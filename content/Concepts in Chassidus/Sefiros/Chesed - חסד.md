## Etymology

The first two letters of Chesed ([[Ches - ח|Ches]] and [[Daled - ד|Daled]]) can be interpreted as "He pities he who doesn't have." The first letter signifies "he pities," and the last letter, when spelled out in Aramaic, means "he who has not." This implies that Chesed dispenses kindness to the utterly destitute individual who has nothing of his own, without setting a limit or measure to his giving.[^1]

## Definitions

Chesed is the fourth of the Ten [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] and the first of the Seven [[Middos - מידות|Middos]].

This is the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of flowing energy, giving, the desire to bestow.[^2] It is the very crystallization of the disposition to give good and kindness just for the very sake of kindness, regardless of how worthy the recipient may be.[^3]

More generally, the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of Chesed expresses expansion, outward movement from within, broadening and growth.[^2] Therefore, Chesed is called [[Gedulah - גדולה|Gedulah]] ("greatness") [^4]because it comes from the greatness of [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]]. As it is said, "G-d is great…and His greatness is unsearchable."[^5]

[[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] causes life-force and existence [[Yesh Me'Ayin - יש מאין|Yesh Me'Ayin]], for "it is the nature of the benevolent to do good."[^6][^7] The implication of Chesed (creation and its continuous sustenance) is a manifestation of the infinite Chesed that is of the essence of [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]].[^3]
