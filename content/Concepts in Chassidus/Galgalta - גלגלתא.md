## Definitions

In Kabbalah, the Galgalta ("skull") of a [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]] is its [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], which, in psychological terms, represents the will to actualize the content of the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]]. However, when mentioned in Chassidus without context, Galgalta specifically refers to the "Skull" of [[Arich Anpin - אריך אנפין|Arich]], the [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] of [[Arich Anpin - אריך אנפין|Arich]] (i.e., the '[[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] of [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]]').
Just as the skull sits in the head, above the brain, and is higher than the brain, in the realm of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] (within [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]]), Galgalta, the [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] of [[Arich Anpin - אריך אנפין|Arich]], 'sits' above[^1] [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה|Mocha Stima'a]], "The hidden brain," which represents "The '[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]' of [[Arich Anpin - אריך אנפין|Arich]]."[^2]

Arich Anpin is also referred to as Galgalta, or the "skull." It houses the Seven Tikkunim of Galgalta, which correspond to the [[Middos - מידות|Middos]] (emotional attributes) of Arich Anpin.

## The Source of Galgalta

The [[Chesed - חסד|chesed]] of Atik is invested into the [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] of Arich (Galgalta). Atik Yomin represents Taanug, while Arich Anpin represents [[Ratzon - רצון|Ratzon]]. In this context, the flow of pleasure from Atik Yomin "becomes" the interface or source for the subsequent emanation of [[Ratzon - רצון|Ratzon]] in Arich Anpin. This interface is represented by [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]]'s highest [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] and the first step in the transformation of the power of pleasure into the power of will.

## The Difference between the Skull and a Crown

Although Galgalta and [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] can be used interchangeably across Kabbalah, there is an essential difference between [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] and Galgalta.

The skull is an analogy for an encompassing light or power that relates (shayich) to a light or power that is p'nimi, "internalized," like a person's skull, which encompasses the person's brain but nevertheless relates to it. After all, the skull is part of the person's body, just as is his brain.

Although in certain texts of Kabbalah and Chassidus, the skull is sometimes also identified with [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], that is speaking in a general sense. Fundamentally, however, [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] refers to an encompassing light that transcends connection to any degree of influence that is able to be internalized (and which thus transcends the encompassing light described by the analogy of the skull).[^3]

[^1]: Though it does sit above, there is a small gap of "air" in between the two, called "Kruma D'Avirah." This is because when there is such a qualitative "step down," there needs to be a [[Tzimtzum - צמצום|Tzimtzum]] between the two levels. now I'm not sure if it's between that or the proverbial [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]].
