Now it is necessary to explain the concept of the Merkavah (Chariot) of the Patriarchs. The matter is as follows: It is explained in Idra Zuta that Abba and Imma (Father and Mother, corresponding to Chochmah and Binah) emanated from the concealed brain (Mocha Stima'ah), and Ze'ir Anpin (the emotional attributes) is connected to and dependent on Atik (the inner dimension of Keter). This can be understood by analogy to human faculties. Human intellect (Chochmah and Binah, corresponding to Abba and Imma Above) is derived from the faculty of conceptualization (corresponding to Mocha Stima'ah Above), where the revelation of intellect is not felt, but it is the source from which the aspects of Chochmah and Binah are subsequently drawn.

However, the emotional attributes are derived from an even higher place. Although the emotions are called "sons" and "daughters" to the intellectual faculties of Chochmah and Binah, which are called "father" and "mother" - Chochmah is called the "father" of the emotions, and Binah is called the "mother" of the "sons," i.e., the emotions - nevertheless, this is only because through them the emotions are born and revealed from concealment into revelation. But the root of the emotions is from an even higher place.

This is the meaning of "Ze'ir Anpin is connected to and dependent on Atik," the aspect of Atik which is higher than the aspect of concealed Chochmah (Chochmah Stima'ah). Since the root of the aspect of Ze'ir Anpin is higher not only than the aspect of Abba and Imma, but even higher than the aspect of the concealed brain (Mocha Stima'ah), for it is connected to and dependent on Atik, therefore, Ze'ir Anpin has the power to bring about an elevation even in the aspect of Abba and Imma.

In other words it seem that the rebbe is difreciating here between chochmahs and mocha saying that the brain conceptiulizes the chocmah (which comes out from it). now that theyre useed interchangibly it would be understood that it means that chochmah is the lower part of mocha.

the ending of this mamer seems to reinforce that by iquating yisoel saba to chocmah stimah stimah

in parshas tzav likkutei torah the alter rebbe speaks of the 7 lowers of mocha stimah. i would understand this to be yisroel sabba of mocha stimah.
