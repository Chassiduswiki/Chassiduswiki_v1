As was taught by our Sages, of blessed memory, “The World to Come—which here means Gan Eden—was created by the letter _yud_,”(Menachot 29b.) a letter limited and contracted to a single point.

This (letter) signifies the level of supernal _chochmah_ (the first of the ten sefirot of the World of Atzilut),

which is referred to as the Higher _Eden_, that surpasses the level of Gan Eden, inasmuch as gan implies only a garden derived from Eden, and not Eden itself,
and which evolves and becomes vested in all the worlds,

as it is written, “You have made them all with _chochmah_…”([Psalms 104:24](https://www.chabad.org/16325#v24).); i.e., all created beings derive from the sefirah of chochmah.

(It is likewise written), “And _chochmah_ animates…,”([Ecclesiastes 7:12](https://www.chabad.org/16468#v12).) again indicating that the Sefira of chochmah animates all the worlds.

In _Gan Eden_, it is manifestly comprehensible to each according to his measure.
