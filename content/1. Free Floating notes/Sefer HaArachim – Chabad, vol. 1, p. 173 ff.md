The term "Adam Kadmon" refers to the aspect of the [[Ratzon - רצון]] and the primordial thought (Machshava Hakduma) about all the worlds that arose in Machshavto Yisborech. It is the general [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] (כתר הכללי) of the entire chain of emanation ([[Seder Hishtalshelus - סדר השתלשלות|Seder Hishtalshelus]]). Just as each particular world begins [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], which is the particular will (הרצון פרטי) for that world, so too, the entirety of the worlds begins with the general [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] of Adam Kadmon.

for the reason why is called adam kadmon see section 10

This [[Ratzon - רצון]], even though all the details of the worlds have arisen in it, from the highest world to all the details of this lowly world, and all the details of the six thousand years have arisen in this will, nevertheless, all these details are not in it in the aspect of division at all, and it views them all as one. And about this, our Sages, may their memory be blessed, said: "And they are all viewed with one glance," meaning that He sees and looks until the end of all generations in one glance.

The reason for the inclusion in the will of Adam Kadmon, that all the details of the worlds are in it in one glance, is because it is drawn from the aspect of the general will that precedes the contraction (Tzimtzum).

In these two opposites - the will for every detail and one glance - the two powers in the Infinite Light (Ohr Ein Sof) are revealed: the power of expansion and broadening - in the "multitude of details", and the power of contraction and concentration - in the "one glance".

The reason for the "one glance" in Adam Kadmon: Ein Sof is above time, and the creation of the root of time is due to the contraction and expansion that occurred at the beginning of the creation of the world. The contraction and expansion are what cause the existence of the moment of time. And because Adam Kadmon is the first aspect that was drawn from Him, may He be blessed, and there was one contraction and expansion in it, therefore it is only one glance (and when the influx is divided into parts, and the drawing of each part is after the removal of the part that preceded it, then a multitude of moments is created).

### There Are Several Explanations regarding the Nature of the Will of Adam Kadmon:

1. It is a revealed will, but it is a general will that is not in the aspect of division into details.
2. A concealed will and mere agreement that is not yet relevant to actualization.
3. A garment for the Primordial Infinite Light (Ohr Ein Sof HaKadmon), whose garment is from Him and within Him, for even the garment is primordial like the Infinite Light.

These three aspects are in relation to different levels:

In relation to the light that precedes the contraction (Tzimtzum), it is a revealed will, but in the details of the levels of the chain of emanation after the Tzimtzum, it is only a concealed will (and it also preceded the Tzimtzum).

## 2

The intention in the formation of Adam Kadmon is to have an intermediary between the Infinite Light (Ohr Ein Sof) and the chain of emanation, which are opposites of each other: Ein Sof is without limit, while all the worlds are limited within the aspect of (spiritual) space and time. The connection of the worlds with Ein Sof (that they should come into being from Him, and that the revelation of Godliness should be drawn into them) is through the intermediary of Adam Kadmon.

And its intermediary function (like the intermediary function of all intermediaries) is in that it is related and connected to both, to Ein Sof and to the worlds:

Its relation to the worlds is in that it is on their level and includes them, for all the details of the worlds arose in the primordial thought of Adam Kadmon, as mentioned above, and it contains the division of all the details, as mentioned above. And its relation to Ein Sof (is not like the relation of Eden, for just as there is no comparison between the physical world of Asiyah and Adam Kadmon, there is no comparison between Adam Kadmon and Ein Sof. Moreover, in relation to Ein Sof, Adam Kadmon and Asiyah are literally equal, and the formation of Adam Kadmon from Ein Sof is only from the aspect of the letters of the Reshimu alone, and even this is after the Tzimtzum and the empty space. And its relation to Ein Sof is only) in that it is not in the aspect of division and is above time, for it includes all the worlds in one glance, as mentioned above.

Another aspect in the intermediary function of Adam Kadmon: In Adam Kadmon, which is the general crown (Keter) of the entire chain of emanation, there are (like in the particular crowns) two aspects: Atik and Arich (as will be explained in section 6), and by virtue of these two aspects, it is an intermediary between Ein Sof and the chain of emanation: Its connection to the chain of emanation is from the aspect of Arich within it, and its connection to Ein Sof is from the aspect of Atik within it.

Through the will of Adam Kadmon, all the worlds came into being, for as soon as they arose in His will, they immediately came into existence. However, the will of Adam Kadmon itself is not sufficient, and there needed to be a specific will for each world individually. It is specifically through the individual wills that the worlds came into being in the way they are now, as will be explained below. Nevertheless, the actual coming into being of the worlds is also from the will of Adam Kadmon, which is drawn through the individual wills.

The reasons why a complete coming into being, as it is now, cannot occur from the will of Adam Kadmon:

a) From the aspect of Adam Kadmon, all the worlds are equal in terms of the light and revelation within them.

b) Being a general will that is not in a state of division, the worlds that come into being from it are also not in the aspect of division (in their essential existence, and not only in the light and revelation within them).

c) Being a concealed will that is not relevant to actualization, the coming into being from it is not in the aspect of existence at all.

d) Being primordial like Ein Sof, all the levels within it are in the aspect of the Infinite (Ein Sof).

The main aspect of creation and innovation is in the aspect of Adam Kadmon, in which the will for the worlds was renewed.
1. The Will for the "worlds"
2. The worlds that came into being from the will. And all the levels below Adam Kadmon are not innovations in their essential nature, but rather, a revelation of a detail from the general, for the general will of Adam Kadmon and the worlds that came into being from it (in general) were later detailed into individual wills and individual worlds.

The way in which the details of the worlds are included in the generality of Adam Kadmon is not like the inclusion of the effect in its cause and the like, where the actual existence of the lower is present in the higher but in a subtle form. Rather, the aspect of Adam Kadmon is only the hyle (primordial matter) and the potentiality for the worlds that will come into being from it afterwards. And this potentiality itself is the beginning of the coming into being of the worlds. For the levels above Adam Kadmon are not even in the aspect of potentiality but in the aspect of nothingness, and in their emergence from the aspect of nothingness to the aspect of potentiality lies the beginning of their coming into being.

For this reason, Adam Kadmon is called the creation of the generality. For it is the beginning of the coming into being of the general worlds of Formation ([[Akudim - עקודים]] and [[Nekudim - נקודים]]) and Action (the particular ABiYA), similar to the particular world of Creation, which is the beginning of the coming into being and the hyle of the particular worlds of Formation and Action.

(And sometimes it is explained, regarding the fact that Adam Kadmon is called creation, that the entirety of all the worlds is divided into three aspects: Adam Kadmon - Creation, Atzilut - Formation, and BiYA - Action).

However, the fact that Adam Kadmon is called the creation of the generality is only in relation to the light that precedes the contraction (Tzimtzum). But in relation to the levels after the Tzimtzum itself, Adam Kadmon is not called creation, for it is not a separate existence from Ein Sof, as will be explained.

as we find in general And the term "creation of the generality" refers to the aspect of Akudim.

## 4. The Manner of the Coming into Being and Drawing forth of the Particular Worlds from Adam Kadmon:

Even though all the details of the worlds are included in Adam Kadmon, nevertheless, the drawing forth of Atzilut from Adam Kadmon is not similar to the drawing forth of Beriah, [[Yetzirah - יצירה]], and Asiyah (BYA), for Atzilut from Adam Kadmon is in the aspect of the revelation of the concealed, while BYA are in the aspect of innovation. This is because:

(a) What is included in Adam Kadmon is only the spirituality and Godliness of the worlds and not their independent existence. Therefore, BYA, which are in the aspect of independent existence, are not included in Adam Kadmon.

(b) Even the spirituality of BYA that is included in Adam Kadmon is not like the inclusion of Atzilut. The inclusion of Atzilut in Adam Kadmon is in a more internal aspect. For in the will of Adam Kadmon itself, it arose that Atzilut should be Godliness and BYA should be in a state of innovation.

Even Atzilut, being incomparable in relation to Adam Kadmon (as will be explained in section 8), is sometimes referred to as "something from nothing", and the manner of the drawing forth of Atzilut from Adam Kadmon is through contraction (Tzimtzum) and concealment (Parsa).

### Tzimtzum

Even though all the details of the worlds are first included in Adam Kadmon, nevertheless, as they are included in it, they are more concealed than how they later come into revelation. And their superiority (like the superiority of the general over the particular in all aspects) is twofold:

a) Those very details themselves are more concealed, for they are not in the aspect of depiction and division.

b) By virtue of the inclusion of all the details together, there is a more sublime light within them that does not shine in them at all when they become particular entities.

Therefore, the drawing forth of Atzilut from Adam Kadmon is through a great contraction (Tzimtzum), whose effect is twofold:

a) To particularize and diminish the light in each and every detail.

b) So that the sublime light that comes from the combination of all the details together will not shine in them.

And this Tzimtzum is different from the first Tzimtzum, for the first Tzimtzum is by way of removal, because the light that precedes the Tzimtzum is entirely incomparable to that which follows the Tzimtzum. In contrast, the Tzimtzum of Adam Kadmon is only by way of diminishment, because the aspect of Adam Kadmon is also after the Tzimtzum and has a relation to the levels that follow it.

However, it is still not like the contractions of the order of emanation, for in the levels of the order of emanation, the effect is included in its cause (albeit in a subtle form), whereas the aspect of Adam Kadmon is only the potentiality for the levels that follow it (as mentioned above in section 3). Therefore, the Tzimtzum of Adam Kadmon is also a great contraction, leaving an empty space, similar to the first Tzimtzum.

## 10. Reasons for the name "Adam Kadmon"

c. 182

The two names "Adam" and "Kadmon" (in the term "Adam Kadmon") refer to two different and opposite concepts, for the name "Adam" can only be applied to the created,[^1] while the name "Kadmon" refers to the Creator.[^2] And in the term "Adam Kadmon", which is composed of these two concepts, there are several interpretations:

1. The term "Kadmon" in Adam Kadmon is only in relation to the levels of the chain of emanation after the [[Tzimtzum - צמצום]], for in relation to these levels, it is the primordial one, since they all come into being from it.[^3]
2. The interpretation of "Adam Kadmon" is like "Adam HaRishon." Just as Adam HaRishon was the handiwork of Hashem, not like the individuals who came after him, who were born from a father and mother, and is distinct from the individuals who come after him. And the term "first" in relation to him (is not because he is first in relation to the individuals who come after him, for he is not related to them at all, but rather) because the aspect of "first" - the handiwork of Hashem - shines within him.[^4]

	Similarly, Adam Kadmon, its coming into being is from the Infinite Light (Ohr Ein Sof) itself (and not like the Sefirot under it, which were born through unions and couplings). And it is distinct from the Sefirot below it. And the term "Kadmon" in relation to it (is not because it is primordial in relation to the Sefirot below it, but rather) because the aspect of "Kadmon" its coming into being from the Infinite Light itself - shines within it.

3. The interpretation of "Adam Kadmon" is דומה לקדמון "Domeh Lkadmon" (because adam adame Lelyon), because the aspect of Adam Kadmon is likened to the Infinite Light (Ein Sof) (as mentioned above in section 2). And therefore it is called "Adam Kadmon" - and not simply Adam (like the other Partzufim) - for Adam (simply) indicates that it is similar to the aspect of Adam above it (and like the Adam of the Partzufim below Adam Kadmon, which are similar to the aspect of Adam above them)(also note that sometimes that the "adam of Atzlius" is equated to the Ein Sof and not only to the adam above it – the [[Esser Sefiros HaGenuzos - ע''ס הגנוזות]]), and since in Adam Kadmon there is no aspect of Adam preceding it, it is called "Adam Kadmon", for its likeness is to the Infinite Light.
4. The מחשבה ורצון (thought and will) of A"K, even though the will is to bestow good to His creatures (which is why it is called Adam, indicating the created, as mentioned above), nevertheless, this thought arose in the Primordial Infinite Light, and it is a garment to Him which is united with Him (like the law of "a gnat whose garments are from it and within it"), which is why it too is primordial like the Infinite Light.
5. The term "Adam" refers to the aspect of Arich of Adam Kadmon, and the term "Kadmon" refers to the aspect of Atik of Adam Kadmon.

In the term "Adam" in Adam Kadmon, there are two reasons:

a) The name "Adam" indicates the inclusion of all levels, and the aspect of Adam Kadmon includes the entirety of the chain of emanation. (This is why all the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzufim]] are not called by the name "Adam", for each [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]] is a particular aspect, and only Adam Kadmon is called "Adam", because it includes them all).

b) "Adam" is from the language of "I will liken myself to the Most High", and the aspect of Adam Kadmon is likened to the Infinite Light (as mentioned above in section 2).
