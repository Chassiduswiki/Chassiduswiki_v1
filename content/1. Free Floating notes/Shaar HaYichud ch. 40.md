However, both these aspects exist even in the desire, which transcends intellect.

(In other words, this is the aspect of, “The Hidden Binah” (Binah Stima’ah) of Arich Anpin, which is the concealed thought in the hidden desire. That is, just as there is a hidden intellect and wisdom of Arich Anpin, which is, “hidden from all conceptualization,” and is the hidden Chochmah of Arich Anpin, [[Chochmah Stima'a - חכמה סתימאה]]; which, as known, is called טעם כמוס לרצון, the hidden reasoning for the desire, so likewise, there is an aspect of, “The Concealed Binah” (Binah Stima’a) etc.)

This is similar to the difference that we observed between the two types of thought, mentioned above about revealed thought.

This is to say that there is the desire that becomes revealed in the brain, which is the desire in the nerves of the brain. It is called, “the concealed thought” (Machshava Stima’ah), because of the concealment of this desire in the brain before it comes to Chochmah and Binah.
