(The form or shape of the letter hey) has dimensions of length and width to indicate the faculty of binah, for the upper hey of the Divine Name denotes the level of binah, which is the expansion of the "concealed intellect" (הַשֵּׂכֶל הַנֶּעְלָם) into a state of manifestation and apprehension, extending into dam, and its diffusion—the diffusion of the flow of binah— culminates in the heart.
Thus, it is written in the Tikkunim that "binah is the heart, and by means of it, the heart understands."

In Zohar [[Chochmah - חכמה]] is referred to as "The Dot in the palace" (Note by the Rebbe: “This is discussed at length in _[[Likkutei Torah, Re'eh 18a]]_; see the sources cited there.”), Though it illuminates [[Binah - בינה]], it still remains as the  point of intellect that is higher than the details of [[Binah - בינה]].

it is the Shape of the Yud "תְּמוּנַת יוּ"ד", in the name Havaye.

[[Chochmah - חכמה]] is also referred to as "Eden", of which "No eye has beheld it.." ([Isaiah 64:3](https://www.chabad.org/15995#v3).), as it is higher than comprehension.

[[Chochmah - חכמה]], is also referred to as “the ‘father’ who founded the ‘daughter" -- "אַבָּא יָסַד בְּרַתָּא" (_Zohar_ III, 248a.) _Chochmah_ is the “father,” or source, of the letters of speech, which are called the “daughter,” the level of _malchut_.
