# **העושה סוכתו תחת האילן כאילו עשאה בתוך הבית**

However, it is necessary to understand that since the commandments are dependent on the name of Havayah, the atonement must come from a level above the chain of emanation (Hishtalshelut). Especially according to what has been explained, that the commandments are in the aspect of the 613 paths of the skull (Galgalta), from which it is understood that the atonement must come from an even higher level. If so, how is it possible for the atonement to come from the level of the concealed wisdom (Chochmah Stimaah), which is the root of the revealed wisdom and lower than the will, the aspect of the skull (Galgalta)?

However, the matter is that within Chochmah Stimaah, there are two levels:
1. The source of the Chochmah Hagaloy
2. the source of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy (Yud-Gimmel Middot HaRachamim).

They are the two encompassing lights within it, the encompassing light of the direct light (Or Yashar) and the encompassing light of the returning light (Or Chozer).

And this is also what is written ,[^1] 'Like the good oil on the head running down on the beard, the beard of [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]],' for the aspect of 'the beard, the beard of [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]]' is the matter of the Yud-Gimmel Tikkunei Dikna [Thirteen Rectifications of the Beard] ,[^2] which are the Yud-Gimmel Middot HaRachamim [Thirteen Attributes of Mercy] drawn down through the service of [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]] the Kohen Gadol [High Priest] in the matter of the Ketoret [Incense]. As it is written, 'For in the cloud I will appear,' 'I will appear' unspecified, which is the drawing down of the Essence, the aspect of the Penimiyut Atik [Inner Dimension of Atik], from which aspect the Kapparah [Atonement] is drawn down for all the blemishes and sins in the Torah and Mitzvot, whose root is from the aspect of Galgalta [Skull]. The Selichah [Forgiveness] is from the aspect of Penimiyut Atik, which is above the aspect of Galgalta, as mentioned above.

This matter is drawn down through the aspect of 'good oil,' the aspect of Chochmah Stima'ah [Concealed Wisdom], which contains two Makifim [Encompassing Lights], Mem and Samech, Makif de-Or Yashar [Encompassing Light of the Direct Light] and Makif de-Or Chozer [Encompassing Light of the Returning Light], which are the two aspects within Chochmah Stima'ah. It is the source of the revealed Chochmah, which is the aspect of Makif de-Or Yashar, and the source of Yud-Gimmel Middot HaRachamim, Makif de-Or Chozer. This is the matter of the aspect of Penimiyut Abba [Inner Dimension of Abba], Penimiyut Atik. In other words, in Galgalta, it is only the Chitzoniyut Atik [External Dimension of Atik] and in the aspect of Makif, whereas in Chochmah Stima'ah, it is the aspect of Penimiyut Atik and in Penimiyut. Because of this, it is the source of Yud-Gimmel Middot HaRachamim, as mentioned above.
