[[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], refers (not to the level of Atik, but rather) to the pinimius of Arich, the level of [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]]. And this Inyan, which was explained above, that the level of Arich, which is the external aspect of [[Kesser - כתר]], is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות]] - this is only in a general sense. But in greater particularity, within the level of Arich itself, there is a Darga (Level) that is not counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]].

And regarding the level of Arich, it is מאשר בכללות הכתר. That is, regarding [[Kesser - כתר]], in a general sense, the external aspect (Arich) is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], while the internal aspect (Atik) is not counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]]. However, regarding the level of Arich itself, it is the opposite - the external aspect is not counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], while the internal aspect is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]].

For the external aspect of Arich is the level of "Kesser ShebiKesser" the bechinah (Level) of [[Galgalta - גלגלתא]], bechinas HaMakif, which transcends the internal aspect of Arich - the level of Chochmah ShebiKesser, [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]]. Therefore, the level of [[Galgalta - גלגלתא]], although it is the external aspect, is not counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]]. In contrast, the level of [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]], although it is the internal aspect (to such an extent that it is called the "internal aspect of Kesser" in relation to [[Galgalta - גלגלתא]] which is called the "external aspect" - and this is because the brain is considered more essential than the skull, as we find in the laws of trefot that a hole in the skull bone is not as severe as a hole in the brain membrane], in any case, it is lower than the level of [[Galgalta - גלגלתא]] and is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]].

And according to this, it makes sense why the המ"ח (ע"פ הע"ח שער מוחין דצלם), stated that in the internal aspect, [[Kesser - כתר]] is counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] - he was referring to [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]] within Arich. And the statement of the Alter Rebbe, that in the internal aspect [[Kesser - כתר]] is not counted, refers to the internal aspect of [[Kesser - כתר]] in a general sense (and does not descend into the distinction between the external and internal within the level of Arich itself). That is, the level of Atik, which according to all opinions, is not counted among the [[Sefiros - ספירות]].
