This then, is the (meaning) of the statement in Etz Chayim, that Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin, which are the pleasure and the desire, are one entity, and that the one cannot be without the other.

(They are called the “three heads which are engraved, one within the other. Sometimes one (pleasure) is internal (and sometimes desire is internal) etc, as mentioned previously.)
(See Zohar III (Idra Zuta) 288a. Also see Eitz Chayim (Shaar Arich Anpin) Shaar 13, Chapter 2.)

Keter, which is the pleasure and desire, is invested within each and every sefirah, even in the most particular of particulars, for without it, it can have no existence at all, as previously explained at length. Moreover, it also encompasses them all.

This is in accordance with what is explained elsewhere with the analogy of the ten pits which are dug in succession. The water in the first is drawn into each subsequent pit etc. Likewise, it states in the Zohar, “He made a big vessel, like a person who makes a big excavation, which becomes filled with the water that comes out of a spring… He then made a small vessel, which is the letter Yud, which became filled with it from the source (Keter), and He called it a spring flowing with Chochmah - Insight.] Through it, He called Himself, ‘Chacham – Wise’, and the vessel He called Chochmah - Insight.” Similarly, it states, “You brought out ten ‘Tikkunim – Vessels’ and called them ten sefirot etc.”) See Ma’amirei Admor HaZaken, HaKtzarim, page 492. See also, Zohar II (Ra’ayah Mehemnah) 42b, and introduction to Tikkunei Zohar 17a.]

This is because the World of The Unlimited One (Ein Sof) is considered to continue until the aspect of Malchut of Adam Kadmon, which is the aspect of the “letters” of the end action that arose in the aforementioned Primal Thought and Desire (Machshava V’Ratzon HaKadoom).

It is these “letters,” which are the last level of the Essential Self of HaShem- Havaye , blessed is He, that become the Keter of Atik Yomin, which is the aspect of the revelation of the light of the pleasure from the aforementioned concealed pleasure and Primal Desire (He’elem Ha’Oneg V’Ratzon HaKadoom).

Therefore, even Keter of Atik Yomin, and the (sefirot) of Chochmah, Binah and the emotions that are within it, are all considered to be of the end of the World of The Unlimited One (Ein Sof).

However, this is not the case with Arich Anpin, which is the aspect of the revelation of the desire that comes because of the pleasure.

Because (the desire) is drawn to spread forth below, it is called the beginning and root of the Emanations, which refers to the ten sefirot of the world of Atzilut, both generally and particularly.

It is for this reason that the aspect of Keter is generally called an intermediary aspect, which possesses something of the last level of the Essential Self of blessed is He, but is the beginning of the Emanated.

Because the lights of the Emanated are in an aspect of "the revelation of the concealed," they therefore are in an aspect of separateness from the Essential Self of blessed is He, as previously explained (in chapter nineteen).

By way of analogy, this is like the emotions of Chessed or Gevurah for a separate thing, which come from the power of the qualities of Chessed and Gevurah of the Essential Self

Nevertheless, it is the aspect of the pleasure and desire which comes from the Essential Self of blessed is He, that vests within everything in order to constantly give them existence, as mentioned previously.

This is because, the source of this pleasure and desire is in the Essential Self of the light of The Unlimited One (Atzmoot Ohr Ein Sof), blessed is He, and is called "the Delight of the King in Himself' (Sha’ashoo’ei HaMelech B’Atzmo).

This is similar to the aforementioned analogy of the soul, which is drawn after every pleasure, which is proof that the pleasure fills its light.

If so, then this itself is the reason that it is from the particular
pleasure within each of the particular (emanations of) lights, that
they primarily (derive) their existence.

(This is true) even until the aspect of Malchut, which is the quality of Dominion.
Were it not for the pleasure in it, it would have no existence.
The absence of the light of the pleasure for something equals the absence of the light of its existence. This will suffice for those of understanding.

Now, all the above is only in a general manner.

In a manner of particulars, however, it is only the aspect of
the first three (sefirot) of Atik Yomin that are considered to be (part) of the Essential Self of the Unlimited One, blessed is He.

On the other hand, the seven lower sefirot of (Atik Yomin)
become invested within the "Gulgulta — Skull" of Arich Anpin.

Chessed (Kindness) of Atik Yomin vests within the "Gulgulta — Skull" of Arich Anpin, Gevurah of Atik Yomin vests within "Mocha Stima 'ah — the Hidden Brain" of Arich Anpin] etc.[^1]

This then, is the meaning of the statement, 'The King who alone is exalted, who transcends the days of the world." This is because the coming into being of the desire from the pleasure is primarily from the aspect of the emotions of the pleasure, as known.
For example, Chessed (kindness) of the pleasure (vests within Keter of the desire).

By way of analogy, when a person is in a state of pleasure during the joy of his son's wedding, or the like, he will then bestow goodness and abundant kindness upon everyone.

This is because of the pleasure that uplifts his soul (for the aforementioned reason).
During such a time, he may be aroused to grant every desire. In other words, even a desire for judgment may be overturned to kindness.

This (overtuming of the desire from Chessed to Gevurah) is dependent upon the aspect of the (essential) point of desire, whichis higher than the "hidden reason for the desire" (Ta 'am Kamoos LaRatzon) that divides into Chessed and Gevurah — kindness and judgment.

This then, is an analogy through which one may understand how the aspect of Chessed of Atik Yomin vests within the "Gulgulta — Skull" (of Arich Anpin).

Now, the aspect of Gevurah, which is judgment, and is the opposite of pleasure, is what vests within "Chochmah Stima'ah — the Hidden Wisdom" of Arich Anpin, which is the "hidden reason
for the desire" (Ta 'am Kamoos LiRatzon).

This is the precision of the desire, that it should be a particular way, and not in any other way.

This is in accordance with what is written in books of Kabbalah, that the early (Kabbalists) decreed and stated that Chochmah is an aspect of judgment.[^2]

This is because, when desire comes according to the dictates of Chochmah, it comes with precision and restriction that it should be like this and not like that.

For this reason, there are many judgments in the laws of the Torah, since the Torah comes out of upper wisdom-Chochmah (chochmah Illah).[^3]

In contrast, the radiance of the thirteen qualities of mercy is from a level higher than the Chochmah of the desire, and can therefore "pardon iniquity."

Certainly (this is the case in regard to) the aspect of the first three sefirot of Atik Yomin, which are not invested in the Emanated.

This is the aspect of the pleasure as it is within Himself. As of yet, no desire whatsoever has been born of it, except that all desires are destined to come from it.
It is considered to be part of the general essence of the simple pleasure (HaTa 'anoog HaPashoot).

That is, it is from the aspect of the source of all pleasures in the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, blessed is He.

This is as stated, With you is the source of life," that is, the source of all the pleasures (within) the Primal Desire (for Creation) (Ratzon HaKadoom).

In the general totality (of the chaining down) it this called [^4] "Atika D 'Atikin — The Ancient of the Ancients."

However, more particularly it is called "Atik Yomin — The Ancient of Days," as stated in Daniel 7:9 "And Atik Yomin sat etc." Atik — Ancient is a terminology of antiquity, which indicates the aspect
of the etrenity of the Essential Self of the limitless light of the eternity of the Essence of the Light of the Unlimited One as He comes to radiate within the chaining down of the line and thread.
However, in regard to His actual Essential Self (it states), [^5] “Is there old age before the Holy One, blessed is He!?”

This is in accordance with what is stated elsewhere regarding the matter of the word "Va 'ed — Forever" which through a permutation of letters equals "Echad — One" referring to the simple Oneness Himself.

For, when the Essential Self of the limitless light of the Unlimited One, blessed is He, who (even)
transcends the time of "Yemei Kedem — the Preceding Days," radiates within time, then time too becomes eternal and is then called "Atik Yomin — the Ancient of Days." This will suffice for those of understanding.
