Then Moses and the children of Israel will sing, etc. And it is necessary to explain why it says "Moses and the children of Israel" in two divisions, and why it doesn't simply say "Then Israel will sing," which would include everything (and in fact, in what is written in Parshat Chukat, "Then Israel sang," the intention is specifically about Israel, etc.). Also, what is the meaning of "Then he will sing," for it seems it should have said "And he sang," etc. And it can be explained according to what we have learned, that when the intellect comes in great division in many different ways, and likewise when it comes in the aspect of descent and greater expansion to bring the matter to such an extent that even a child will understand it, this is specifically from the depth and inwardness of the power of the intellect, etc.
