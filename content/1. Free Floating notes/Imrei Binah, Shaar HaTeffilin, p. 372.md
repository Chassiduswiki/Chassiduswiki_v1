And now, It is necessary to understand what is said here, "every firstborn in general," etc. In truth, since the aspect of the light of Abba (Father) of Atzilus is called "beginning" because it comes out first from the aspect of the concealed essence of the Emanator, as mentioned above and as it is written, [^4]"And Chochmah, where can it be found?" From the "nothingness" of Keter.

This refers to the aspect of the Chochmah Stimah of Arich Anpin through the mazal and Notzer, as is known, the Ohr of Abba nurses from the Eight Mazal etc. Accordingly, even the aspect of the light of Abba is called the aspect of the firstborn, which emerged first from the first power of Chochmah Stimah, (מאחר?) since it is called 'beginning,' meaning the beginning of revelation, which is the first revelation born from the first power of Chochmah Stimah, etc. 

(It is like what is seen with The Koach Hamaskil Hayuli that gives birth to all שכליים from Ayin to [[Yesh - יש|Yesh]]. What emerges first from the generative power in this intellect to comprehend includes everything that is destined to be born in detail. It is like [the development] between the ages, from time to time, as understood from age 13 to age 20. When one is 13 years old, the first power emerges, and what will later give birth to intellect in the emotions until age 20 was all included in it, etc. Similarly, from age 20 onward, in the essence of the intellect, at age 20, it includes everything that one is destined to comprehend, etc. 

All this is from the aspect of the image of man that includes all the details that come afterwards. (It is like in a bud, etc., where what is destined to be actualized is recognizable in potentia, and similarly, there is something like this in the power that emerges first.

Accordingly, it is precisely in this power that emerges first, which is the Ohr Chochmah, that includes what is destined to emerge after it, such as through Mazal, and nurses to give birth to the Moach of Binah. How much more so regarding what is destined to emerge from the Koach Hamaskil in the Middos of the Binah Stimah of Arich Anpin, etc. 

(Also, the Ratzon born from the Chochmah Stimah was preceded by the first power of the power of "Mah" of Chochmah, which is called "Adam Kadmon," as in "I will see the beginning," etc.)

This is what is meant by "every firstborn in general," where the word "every" implies a matter of abundance. And when it says "firstborn in general," it includes and conceals everything, for this is only in the Ohr of Abba itself, which is called "the crown of all," (כתרא דכליל) etc., 

and not in what merely branches out from it in the aspect of the beginning. Rather, it is itself the beginning, and all the power of the aspect of the Chochmah Stimahh of Arich Anpin is in it, in the manner explained above regarding the firstborn strength of the firstborn that is born, etc. For Chochmah itself is found in the aspect of birth from Ayin to [[Yesh - יש|Yesh]], but it is called "every firstborn in general," and this will suffice for the understanding.

And this is what is meant to further explain his words. Every firstborn (Kol Bechor) [refers to] drawing from above, the concealed [aspect] of everything, meaning the drawing from above, i.e., above Chocmah itself, which is called "the beginning." 

And just as "before" [^1] the "eye" of Wisdom is called "eye," and before the "eye" is in the aspect of Chochmah Stimahh, the source that influences from the nothingness of Keter, etc.

(And as explained elsewhere[^2] regarding"He declares the end from the beginning  (מגיד מראשית אחרית)," which is the Chochmah Illah and the Chochmah Tatah, and the "before" is the primordial intellect in the Chochmah Stimah (קדמות השכל שבחכמה סתימאה)). 

According to what is explained above, there are two levels in Chochmah Stimah. 
1. The first is called "Pele" (wonder), which ascends to the aspect of Keter within Keter, which always remains concealed.
2. The second, which is occasionally revealed, etc.

refers to what is mentioned here, these two levels: the drawing from above that is revealed at times, which is the aspect of the Yesod Chochmah Stimah that is occasionally revealed to the emanated [beings] (and as it says, [^3]"And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon," [referring to] the Chochmah Tatah from the Yesod of Chochmah Stimahh). And what is said, "the concealment of everything," which is completely concealed from everything, etc., refers to the aspect of "Pele" mentioned above, which is the aspect of the unknowable head (רישא דלא אתיידע), as mentioned above.
