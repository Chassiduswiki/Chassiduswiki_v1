To further explain, there is a membrane ([[Kruma - קרומא]]) that hovers over the brain.
Now, as known, this membrane covers over the Hidden Brain (Mo’ach HaSatoom/[[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]]) which is even loftier than the Hidden Wisdom ([[Chochmah Stima'a - חכמה סתימאה]]), which in the soul, is the power of conceptualization (Ko’ach HaMaskeel). 

This is the matter of the air ([[Avira - אוירא]]) above the membrane ([[Kruma - קרומא]]) upon which the membrane ([[Kruma - קרומא]]) hovers etc. 


Now, the reason that a person has difficulty understanding, is because his membrane is thick and coarse (which is not so of a person who understands easily, whose membrane ([[Kruma - קרומא]]) is thin and refined). 

Nevertheless, through exerting oneself and toiling (through hard work) to refine the membrane that obstructs and conceals (He’elem), since the concealment (He’elem) includes all the levels of the intellectual matter, up to its essence, only that it is in a state of concealment, therefore, by exerting himself in toiling and refining his membrane ([[Kruma - קרומא]]), he comes to grasp and understand the matter more than a person who grasps quickly and easily.
