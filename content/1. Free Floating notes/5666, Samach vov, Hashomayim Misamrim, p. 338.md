…But the level of the Supernal Father and Mother, which are the Mochin of the Father and Mother, is higher than the source for Zeir Anpin etc. We see that the source for Zeir Anpin is the level of the externalities of the Brain (חיצוניות המוחין), the levels of Yisroel Saba and Tevunah. In general it is the level of the "Seven Lower" (and more specifically, it is only Netzach, Hod, and Yesod). However, what is invested in the inwardness of Zeir Anpin is only the aspect of the externality of Tevunah, the aspect of Netzach, Hod, and Yesod of Imma, which become the intellect for Z"A (for although the general aspect of Tevunah is NHY of Binah, nevertheless, what becomes the intellect for Z"A is the aspect of NHY of Tevunah). The level of pinimus of Tevunah is the level of Kesser and Makif to Zeir Anpin.
