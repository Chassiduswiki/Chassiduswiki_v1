And these Tefillin ( of the head, Mocha Ila'ah [Upper Brain] that is drawn into Mocha Tata'ah [Lower Brain], are called Tarin Mochi [Two Brains], and they are as it is written, "Chochmot [Wisdoms] sing outside," and they are explained in one. 

It is known that the explanation of Mocha Ila'ah is the aspect of Chochmah Stima'ah [Hidden Wisdom] of Arich Anpin, which is called Chochmah within Keter [Crown]. 

And the explanation of Mocha Tata'ah is the aspect of Chochmah of Ze'ir Anpin, and it is called Mocha Tata'ah. And when it is drawn from the Mocha Stima'ah of Arich Anpin into the Mocha of Ze'ir Anpin, then it is called "Chochmot," two "Chochmot," etc. And this is the simple meaning of the saying, "And these Tefillin of the head," meaning, the main aspect of the Tefillin of the head is that Mocha Stima'ah is drawn into the Mochin of Ze'ir Anpin, and then they are called "Tarin Mochi," etc.

And indeed, one must understand the simple meaning of this saying, how can it be said that specifically when Chochmah Stima'ah is drawn into Ze'ir Anpin, it is called "two Chochmot," "Tarin Mochin," and not before that? 


Behold, even before Mocha Stima'ah is drawn into Ze'ir Anpin, it is called "two Chochmot," Chochmah at the beginning, Chochmah Stima'ah, Chochmah at the end, Chochmah of Ze'ir Anpin (חכמה דזעיר אנפין) (like [[Anpin Ravrevin]] [Greater Countenance] and [[Anpin Zutrei]] [Lesser Countenance], etc.). 

And further, one must understand what is said, "And these Tefillin of the head" specifically, and not Tefillin of the hand, etc., for "You shall bind them" and "for frontlets" that are written regarding the Tefillin of the head are also said about the Tefillin of the hand. 

(And furthermore, at the beginning of the saying, it already stated that the drawing of Mocha Stima'ah, which is Mocha Ila'ah, into that Ze'ir Anpin, which is Mocha Tata'ah, four Mochin are found. If so, what is this that it returned here to say that Mocha Stima'ah is drawn, etc.? And if it is because it is called "two Chochmot," this does not need an explanation, for it is already understood by implication from what was said, that four Mochin are found, etc., and this will suffice.)
