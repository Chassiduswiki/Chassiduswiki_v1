Every time Chazal say "Hayom," it's eternal; until this very day. So, we need to understand how *Re'eh* is applicable today, and also why the choice of *lifneichem hayom* specifically?

Within all Jews, there are levels of pnimius and chitzonius. It's written, "face to face [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] spoke to you," because during the giving of the Torah, there was a "meeting" of Hashem's name, Havaye, and the pnimius of every Jew. The name of Havaye was drawn into every Jew, and that is the concept of receiving the command that "I am Hashem, your God," that Havaye should become your God.

To explain how the name Havaye is within every Yid, Chazal say that even Rishonim are full of thoughts of repentance, which come from the level of [[Chochmah - חכמה]]. It's called the level of Maskil, and from that level of Maskil comes איתן Strength). This level gives Jews strength in the face of stubbornness and stiff-neckedness. This level is a simple will that has no understanding to it.  איתן  refers to the future, "it'll continue to be strong." In the future, that level of [[Chochmah - חכמה]] will be revealed inside every Yid. though now the Ruach Shtus covers it up and makes a jew think that even though they sinned they're still Jewish (as explained in Tanya, ch. 24.) 

The work "Ezrachi" demonstrates that every individual, as a citizen of the land, is inherently connected to eternity. This is because Jews arise in Hashem's "Primordial Thought," the source of everything. This profound connection is symbolized by the level of [[Chochmah - חכמה]], which is hinted at by the Yud in the name Havaye.

(Please refer to Iggeret HaTeshuva, ch. 4, where it discusses "ביום השמיני שלח" and "יונתי בחגוי," which relates to the concept of the primordial thought, and see further in the same section where it discusses "בשעה שהקדימו ישראל נעשה,'" and see further in the same section where it discusses "Israel is to me like a head," and see further in the same section where it discusses "Hashem is for me as a helper," meaning all the citizens of Israel, meaning what I am destined to shine forth, etc. And the two meanings are true, (both that Ezrach always was and that it will be) that in the future it will shine forth and illuminate this aspect in revelation in all jews.)

The letter Hey in the name Havaye refers to the level of [[Binah - בינה]], which is compared to a wide river with length and breadth. This refers to meditating on the greatness of Hashem, each person to their ability, recognizing how Hashem is One in the heavens and the earth below, and everything before Him is like nothing.

These two levels of the Yud and Hey need to be constantly before a person. They cannot be separated, as it says in the Zohar, "two good friends that never separated," תרין ריעין דלא מתפרשיו, that's how it should be by a person as well. Therefore, a person needs to meditate at length and in breadth, becoming nullified to Hashem and cleaving to Him (dovko bo) with complete self-sacrifice.

In a way of [[Chochmah - חכמה]], which is higher than any mortal understanding (בבחי׳ חכמה שלמעלה מטעם ודעת המושג).

Because if the level of Bittul (ביטול) is missing, even if a person meditates on the greatness of Hashem extensively according to their capability—even if love and fear result from it—it won't last, and this person can fall from their level, Chas Veshalom. Chochmah gives life to its owner, even if he is a master in this level, because though meditation does have an advantage over the level of Bittul, as no thought can grasp Him and in meditation, thoughts do grasp something, nevertheless, chochmah gives it its vitality and is called "a point in the palace."

(oil is chochmah Illah)

The dot gives light to the palace. If you have the whole palace and no point, you don't have anything. And if there is no palace, there is nothing. That's why they're "two good friends that can't be separated." you need both. They're not separated below (in the person) and above (in the Shem Havaye).

"And in the letter Vav" - The letter Vav of the name of Hashem represents the concept of "Nachal Eisan" (a strong stream). From the aforementioned level of "Eisan", a stream descends, which is a drawing down to the lower level of the emotions in the heart, which are divided into six aspects. This is the aspect of the Vav, to transform them to holiness.

Afterwards, it reaches the level of the final Hei, which represents the 3 [[Levushim - לבושים|Levushim]] of thought, speech and action, corresponding to the three lines in the final Hei. 

Top and right, which are attached, those are machshava and dibur and the disconnected line on the left, is maaseh.

This is the aspect of the Oral Torah, which is called Malchut (Kingship), "the mouth". And "great is study that leads to action." 

(the concept of "נחל איתן" is explained at the end of Tanya in the chapter beginning "וצדקה כנחל איתן", that it is the illumination of the Supernal Wisdom (Chochmah Illah) that shines in the inner heart to be completely nullified in His unity, from the depths of the heart. This is also explained in the discourse beginning "בכ״ה בכסליו", that the inner heart unites with the mind in the aspect of "two friends" etc. This is the concept explained later in Parshat Nitzavim, in the discourse beginning "כי המצוה הזאת", in the explanation of "From the depths I called You" (ממעמקים קראתיך) in plural, because there is depth above depth etc. 

Teshuvah is Tashuv Hei, with its full spelling Hei and Yud, where the Hei is the aspect of Higher Teshuvah (תשובה עילאה), which comes from the depth of the heart (מעומק הלב), and the addition (במילוי) (?) of the Yud is the aspect of the "hidden things of the heart" (תעלומות לב שבהעלם) etc. 

These are the two Yesodot (foundations) of Abba and Imma, because the Yesod of Imma, Binah, is the heart, which is the inner aspect of the heart, the depth of the heart. And the Yesod of Abba is the illumination of the Supernal Wisdom (Chochmah Illah) that shines in the inner heart and is called "the hidden things of the heart" (תעלומות לב) . This is explained in the discourse on the verse "ביום השמיני שלח" mentioned above. See also below on the verse "ושמתי כדכד", that this love drawn from the Supernal Wisdom (Chochmah Illah) is called "אבני חפץ", which is "deep, deep" etc. 

Now, "delight" (Chefetz) is the inner aspect of the will, and this is the meaning of "I desired no one with You on earth" (Tehilim 73:23). The will is its external aspect, and this is the root of the concept of a "point in its palace" (נקודה בהיכליה), as explained in the Arizal's commentary on the Idra (22a), that the aspect of Galgalta (is this in reality or in the [[Sefiros - ספירות|sefiros]]?) which surrounds the brain is the aspect of [[Binah - בינה]] which is a palace for the Chochmah hidden (נקודה בהיכליה) within it. This is as explained earlier at the end of Parshat Shlach regarding the verse "לי ראש". 

Now, [[Chochmah - חכמה]] has its source in [[Chochmah Stima'a - חכמה סתימאה]], and this is why the love drawn from Chochmah is called "אבני חפץ" etc. This is the concept of "תעלומות לבו". 

The Zohar states in Parshat Beshalach (63b), in the explanation of "From the depths", "The depth of all, the depth of the well", which are the two Yesodot of Abba and Imma, a point in its palace etc. Meaning, the Supernal Wisdom (chochmah illah) in the inner heart, "Return, Hei" with the addition (millui) of Yud. Through this, it also arouses above the aspect of "From the depths", which is the aspect of Galgalta and the Wisdom hidden within it, the aspect of "Your thoughts are very deep" etc., which are the root and source of the concept of a point in its palace, as mentioned above. 

This is the meaning of "When Israel answers 'Amen, may His great Name be blessed', the Holy One, blessed be He, nods His head", as will be explained later, "May the Name of Hashem be great", (יהי שם י״ה רבא שיגדל בחי׳ שם י״ה), meaning the revelation of the Name Yud-Hei, which is the revelation of Chochmah and Binah, the aspect of "נחל איתן" etc. 

Therefore, through this, the revelation of His will and desire, the aspect of "From the depths I called You, The depth of your thoughts" etc., is drawn from above. See also about the concept of "איתן" in the Zohar, Parshat Vayechi (230b), in Saba deMishpatim (110a) "There is a Maskil above" etc. (112), in Parshat Terumah (170b), and in Parshat Acharei (66b), and in Mikdash Melech there. 

The concept of these aspects alluded to in the name of Hashem is the concept of receiving the Torah in the utterance "I am Hashem your G-d". 

This is what the Sages said regarding a fetus in its mother's womb (עובר בבטן אמו): "A candle is lit above its head and it is taught the entire Torah." (נר דלוק על ראשו ומלמדין אותו כל התורה כולה) The lit candle is the aspect of the Yud in the name of Hashem, and "it is taught the entire Torah" is the aspect of the final Hei in the Name, to tell you that the entire concept of these aspects in the name of Hashem, from Yud to the final Hei, is taught to it so that after its birth and emergence into the air of the world, it will be easier for it to grasp and absorb these aspects in its mind and heart (בנקל תפיסת וקליטת הבחינות האלו במוחו ולבו) and to emerge from concealment to revelation (see what is explained about this in the discourse on the verse "שחורה אני ונאוה" in Shir HaShirim, and in Parshat Shlach on the verse "והיה לכם לציצית". This is the meaning of "משכני אחריך נרוצה הביאני המלך חדריו" etc., as explained elsewhere).
