[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is the root of the succeeding attributes.

That is why it is called Reishit (Beginning)  

*==Zohar I:3b, et passim. See Igeret Hakodesh, sect. V and the==*
*==references cited in note 76 ( 82) a.l.==* 

[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is called Reishit regardless of whether [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] is counted or not. 
When [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] is included we speak of two spheres that are called Reishit: [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] and [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] (as alluded in the first word of the Torah: Be-Reishit, i.e.. Two (categories of) Reishit); see Tohar I:31b.

[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] represents the first creative activity of G-d;

Thus in relation to [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] which is Ayin, [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is called [[Yesh - יש|Yesh]] (a substance)
==See Pardess Rimonim 5:4; Tanya I, ch. 2 and 11:9.==
==See also R. Dov Ber of Mezhireeh, Maggid Devarav Leya’akov, ed. Kehot,==
==sect. 176, and his Or Torah, Kedoshim, p. 82a.==

it is the initial Divine instrument of actual creation. 

====See Tanya I: ch. 35; Igeret Hakodesh, sect. IV, note 20* (25).==

The Ein Sof, through the mediation of [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], is “vested” in [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], and thence begins creation.

Thus it is written: ==(Psalms 104:24; Proverbs 3:19.)==
“You have made them all be-[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]”; and “the Eternal has founded the earth be-[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]." 

Be-[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] may be translated in two interrelated ways, both of which are significant in our context.
==(The same applies to the first word of the Torah: Be-Reishit {Reishit referring to [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], as said); see Igeret Hakodesh, sect. V,==
==notes 22 and 76 (82) ff.)==

The first sense is with, or by, [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]; thus [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is the instrument and hyle of creation.

==See Nachmanides on Genesis 1:1, and cf. Moreh Nevuchim 11:30.==
==—The term hyle is applied here to [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] in the extended sense of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] being the basic “substance” of creation that can be referred to as [[Yesh - יש|yesh]] (cf. note 43 supra). Strictly speaking the term hyle relates to [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], for “[[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] is like unto the prime matter that is called hyle which contains within it — in potency, though not in actu — the root of all four elements";== 
==Etz Chayim 42:1; see also R. Chaim Vital, Arba Meot Shekel Kessef {ed. Tel Aviv 1964), p. 94a-b.==

Everything derives from [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]].

[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is immanent in everything (albeit in ever-increasing concealment) and animates everything, as it is written “[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] gives life to them that have it” {Ecclesiastes 7;12).

==See Tanya I:ch. 18; Igeret Hakodesh, sect. XIV and XVII.==

The second sense is in [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]. This means that in [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is founded the creation, and the possibilities of all further beings exist there in potentia.

==Ibid, (note 48 supra), and Tanya I: ch, 19; Igeret Hakodesh, sect. V, note 22. “All the lower ones are rooted and compounded in [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], which is the mystical principle of ‘you have made them all in [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]” ’; Etz Chayim 25:1.==

Thus the word [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is interpreted to mean כ”ח ם”ה , the “potentiality” of “what is”.

==The letters of the word חכמה make up כ”ח מ”ה ; Zohar III:235b.==
==See also Tikunei Zahar, Intr.: 4a and 69:112b; Zohar Chadash, 34b-c==
==and 100a ff.; Tanya 1: ch. 3.==

[[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is the seed of creation, the beginning and first revelation of creation. 

However, [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is so concentrated and compact that it is not apprehensible in itself. In itself [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is a state of obscurity ( [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]] —the concealed brain). 

Among the letters of the Tetragrammaton which symbolise all the Sefirot, [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is represented by the first letter, the Yud; A small, simple, non-descriptive point; and it is referred to as Eden ==(Zohar III :290a; see also ibid., II :90a.)== of which it is said ==(See Berachot 34b; Tikunei Zohar, Intr.: 12a.)== “no eye has seen it”. ==(Igeret Hakodesh, sect. V, and notes 16 ff. a.l)==

Thus there is little that can be said of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], for which reason [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], too, is referred to as ayin (naught). 

==See infra, note 63; Igeret Hakodesh, sect. XL Cf. Tanya I: ch. 19.==

The potentia of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is brought out from total obscurity and externalised in Binah, the next This will be understood by drawing on the analogy to the faculties of the human intellect: [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] corresponds to an intuitive flash of intellectual
illumination: the original idea per se.

It is the seminal idea, the “inner thought”, the details of which are not yet differentiated and extemahsed; they are not yet processed but intensely concentrated in the intuitive flash. 

When cogitating on the idea, its details and implications will become revealed; the idea will be understood. The individuations concealed in the original flash are then externalised and become manifest in the mind. The hidden intellect is apprehended by the intellectually cognising subject. This is the facultymand state of Binah (understanding).
