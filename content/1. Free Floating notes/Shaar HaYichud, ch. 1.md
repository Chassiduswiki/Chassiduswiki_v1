[[Chochmah - חכמה]] which is called “Ayin - nothing.” (אין) (See Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 42; Maamarei Admor HaEmtza’ee, Bereshit p.2) This is as stated, “A river goes out from Eden.”

[[Binah - בינה]] (understanding) is called a river, while [[Chochmah - חכמה]] (insight) is called a spring.

At first glance, this aspect of [[Iyun -]] is called “the delving of the concentration” 
(העמקת הדעת) in common usage.
In truth, this is not the case, for the delving of the concentration is only a vessel (Keli), that allows one to come to the actual depth (Omek) of the concept.

A higher level than this is called “delving” (Ma’amik) (מעמיק) .
This method of delving allows one to reach higher than even [[Chochmah - חכמה]] itself. (See the explanations of the famed Chassid of the Mittler Rebbe, Rabbi Hillel of Paritch, to Chapter 1, translated and annotated under the title Listen Israel.)

Now, seemingly, [[Chochmah - חכמה]] is literally an aspect of the intangible “nothingness” of the concept, (האין ממש של המושכל) , as it exists even before it comes into the category of bAying the essential depth or point (Nekuda) of the concept in the comprehension of [[Binah - בינה]]. As mentioned previously, it is like the waters of a spring in comparison to the waters of a river.

Nonetheless, the aspect of delving in this source of the concept (haamaka Bishoresh shel hamaskil), its source reaches into the very source of the flow of the
waters of the spring of Chochmah (Nivias MayAyin D'chochmah), which is called “the depths of Chochmah”(עמקי החכמה) or “the hidden-ness of Chochmah.” (תעלומות חכמה) ([[Nivias Maayin D'Chochmah - נביעת מעין החכמה]] or Ta’alumot Chochmah. See also Job 11:6) 

Just as there are depth, length and width in [[Binah - בינה]], which is called “yesh – something,” there is likewise a depth, length and width in the spring of [[Chochmah - חכמה]] which is called “Ayin – nothing.”

[[Chochmah - חכמה]] is a new insight that emerges like a bolt of lightning (כברק).
even though it does have a parallel in the realm of [[Binah - בינה]], Omek Hamusag, that is only Yesh MayAyin of Binah. The Yesh MayAyin of [[Chochmah - חכמה]] (before it enters the category of "[[Hasaga -]]"), is incomparable. Its on a level of its own, so to speak. 

And even though "[[Omek Hamusag -]]," which is called the 50th gate of [[Binah - בינה]], is sourced from the depths of [[Chochmah - חכמה]], ..... (TBC) (p. 19-20)
