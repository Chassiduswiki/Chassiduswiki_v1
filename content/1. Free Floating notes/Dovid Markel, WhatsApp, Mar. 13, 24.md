Some osiyos on the difference between חיצניות המוחין and פנימיות המוחין

Chitzoniyos ha[[Mochin - מוחין]] are the tziyur of [[Mochin - מוחין]] as they are formed by the kli hamochin. Which means to say, the kli/tziyur of mochin is the signon of intellectualism. When a person is stimulated by intellect, it often makes no difference what the idea is per se, but they are stimulated by the complexity of the thing. The idea, is secondary. In such a baal mochin, midos are a stira to their intellectualism.

Pnimiyus Hamochin is always attached not to the intellect of the idea, but the idea of the idea, the ohr of the idea, not the keilim that form it. When a person is not stimulated by the "intellect," but the idea itself, it's ohr, there is no real difference between midos and mochin. So in such a person who is davuk to the idea will also be davuk emotionally--but with less hispaalus as they are drawn to the idea with their whole identity.
