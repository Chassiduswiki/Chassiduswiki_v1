....As is known, that Chochmah of Atik is called [[Sechel Mufla - שכל מופלא|Sechel Mufla]] ([[Sechel Mufla - שכל מופלא|שכל מופלא]]), because its a total Pele from the perspective of Chochmah and its not like Chochmah stima of Arich that is called [[Sechel Ne'elam - שכל נעלם|Sechel Ne'elam]] ([[Sechel Ne'elam - שכל נעלם|שכל נעלם]]) because it is only hidden regarding Chochmah of Atzilus, which it is the source of. But, "[[Sechel Mufla - שכל מופלא|Sechel Mufla]]" is not considered (שאינו בבחינת) a source at all etc. [^1]

And its says in Likkutei Torah, Shelach,מט, ד in the name of Eitz Chaim, Shaar 22, ספו. that Kesser is a Ohr Ruchni that is makif it from above galgalta, and this is Pinimus HaKesser, as mentioned above, that is higher than Galgalta and Mocha Stimah etc. and it Shaar Arich Anpin, Shaar 7. that this kesser also has a Mocha Stimah that is very hidden, which is called avira.....
