 The אויר שעל הקרום החופה למוחא םתימאה is located between the Mocha Stima (and the membrane above it) and [[Galgalta - גלגלתא|Galgalta]]. [^1]
 And it…

a) Connects the aspect of [[Galgalta - גלגלתא|Galgalta]] with the aspect of the Mocha Stima, being the intermediary between them. For in [[Galgalta - גלגלתא|Galgalta]] is enclothed [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]] of [[Atik Yomin - עתיק יומין|Atik]], in the Mocha Stima - [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]] of [[Atik Yomin - עתיק יומין|Atik]], and in [[Avira - אוירא|Avira]] - Tiferet of [[Atik Yomin - עתיק יומין|Atik]]. And Tiferet is the intermediary that connects [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]] and [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]].[^2]

(And similarly, this is also regarding the aspects of NHY ([[Netzach - נצח|Netzach]], [[Hod - הוד|Hod]], [[Yesod - יסוד|Yesod]]) of [[Adam Kadmon - אדם קדמון|Adam Kadmon]]that are enclothed in Kesser, that Netzach of Adam Kadmon is on the right in Galgalta, Hod - on the left in the Chochmah Stima, and Yesod - in the middle in the air between Galgalta and the Chochmah Stima.) [^3]

b) Connects and joins the aspect of the Mocha Stima - which in man corresponds to the aspect of the power of the intellect (Koach HaMaskil)- to come into revelation.[^4]
And it weighs how much the revelation of wisdom will be. [^5]
This is what is written, "He causes the wind to blow and the rain to fall," for the drawing down of the Torah ([[Chochmah - חכמה]]) from the aspect of the Mocha Stima, which is called "He causes the rain to fall," is through the aspect of air - "He causes the wind to blow." [^6]

The reason it is called "air" (Avira) (or: "supernal air" (Avira Illah); "pure air" (Avira Dechiya)) is because of its two aforementioned aspects:

A) Air is the intermediary that connects water and fire, and similarly, the aspect of air connects the aspect of Galgalta (Chesed - water) with the aspect of the Mocha Stima (Gevurah - fire).

B) Air is the source and root of light, and similarly, the aspect of air is what connects the aspect of the Chochmah Stima to come into the revelation of wisdom, and the aspect of wisdom is called light.

This air, although it is above the aspect of the Mocha Stima (Koach Hamskil), is not the aspect of essence (the soul), but only its radiance alone. Moreover, it is lower even than the aspect of Galgalta [^7] (Kesser of [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], which in man corresponds to the aspect of the simple will that is above hidden reason), to the point that it is called "brain" (concealed) in relation to it, indicating an internal aspect.

- Regarding its connection to Binah, and the names Sa"G (63) and KaSA (161) in it - see below, section 4, subsection 2.

## Avir in relation (?) to Mocha Stimah & (revealed) Chochmah

Despite the fact that in relation to the aspect of Galgalta it is called "brain," in relation to the Mocha Stima, it is called "skull," [^8] because it is in the aspect of encompassing it.

However, the encompassing of the air is not similar to the encompassing of Galgalta (Kesser of Kesser), for
(a) the aspect of Galgalta is a big Makif, and the aspect of "air" is a small Makif.[^9]
(b) Moreover, the aspect of "skull" is the direct encompassing (and therefore its root is in the aspect of the great circle), and the aspect of "air" - the returning encompassing.

Therefore, it is sometimes explained that air is the aspect of the inner dimension of the Mocha Stima (because what encompasses the Mocha Stima is only the returning encompassing). This is why it is called "brain," because it has some connection to the intellect.

From the two aforementioned aspects in the level of the aspect of air - that it is above the aspect of the Mocha Stima and yet it has some connection to the intellect to the point that it is called "brain" - there are two explanations regarding the relation of the intellect to it:

a) The drawing down of the intellect from the aspect of air is in the manner of Yesh M'Ayin (something from nothing). For the aspect of air is devoid of the matter of intellect (unlike the Koach Hamaskil (called the Mocha Stima) which is the aspect of "general" and "heyuli" for the revealed intellect).[^10]

b) The drawing down of the intellect from it is not in the manner of something from nothing. For it has some connection to the intellect. (And the matter of "something from nothing" in the drawing down of the intellect is only in relation to the aspect of Galgalta, which is above the aspect of air).

- In the three levels of source, spring, and stream (in the drawing down of the intellect), this air is called "source" (and the power of the intellect (the aspect of the Mocha Stima) is generally included in the aspect of "spring").

Despite the fact that the air is an intermediary between the Mocha Stima and Galgalta, lower than Galgalta, it has an advantage over the aspect of Galgalta, to the point that the aspect of Galgalta is an external aspect in relation to it. For in this air shines from the supernal aspect of Atik, which does not shine in the aspect of Galgalta, as will be explained later.

- From the radiance of the aspect of Atik in the air, the [[Yud Gimmel Middos HaRachamim - י''ג מידות הרחמים|Thirteen Attributes of Mercy]] (- the Tikkunei Dikna) have the power to atone for the blemishes in the performance of the commandments - even though the root of the commandments is in Galgalta (and the Thirteen Tikkunei Dikna are only the drawing down from Galgalta in the aspect of hair) - because the inner dimension of the Tikkunei Dikna is from the aspect of air, in which the aspect of Atik, which is above [[Galgalta - גלגלתא|Galgalta]], is revealed.
