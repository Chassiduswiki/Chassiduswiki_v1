....And regarding [[Sechel - שכל|Sechel]] - through which light is created for him (the person) - there are generally three levels:

(1) The aspect of the intellect as it is utilized in practical matters, from which thought, speech and action are derived. In the language of Chassidus this is called Mochin ShebiMiddos - מוחין שבמדות, the intellect within the emotions/attributes.

(2) The aspect of the intellect as it is in and of itself, generally referred to as Chochmah, wisdom.

(3) The source of the intellect, which in the language of Chassidus is called [[Chochmah Stima'a - חכמה סתימאה]], concealed wisdom or the Koach Hamaskil - כח המשכיל, intellectual faculty.

And the difference between them:

(1) Mochin ShebiMiddos - מוחין שבמדות, this is within the measure and limitation (במדידה והגבלה) of the world.

(2) The intellect as it is in and of itself - it is not within the measure and limitation of the world, but it is within the measure and limitation of the person, for they are the inner faculties of the soul (כחות פנימיים של הנפש).

(3) And the intellectual faculty - this transcends even the measure and limitation of the person, which is why even with the vessel of one's intellect, one cannot grasp it.
