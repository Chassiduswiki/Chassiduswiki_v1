And the Yud is in the aspect of [[Chochmah - חכמה]] as known, and that is that [[Chochmah - חכמה]] is the aspect of the secret of secrets (רזא דרזין), Binah is also on the level of mystery (רז וסוד), this is the Inyan (?) of [[Alma D'iskasya -]]. 

And [[Chochmah - חכמה]] is the level of Secrets of Secrets that are hidden (רזא דרזין סתימא), all hiddenness that are hidden even from the level of hiddenness, and these are the levels of Chochmah Stimah and the Pinimius of Chochmah Stimah. 

And as is known, there are two levels of concealment:
1. The first is that it is concealed from the recipients, meaning not that the light is concealed, but rather because the recipients are unable to receive the light itself.
2. And the second is the aspect of essential concealment, which is not at all in the category of revelation at all.

And these are the two levels of Chochmah Stimah:
1. the aspect of the external dimension of Chochmah Stimah which is the source for the revealed Chochmah
2. and the aspect of the inner dimension of Chochmah Stimah which is not at all in the aspect of a source for Chochmah itself. And it is the aspect of the supernal concealed mind of Atik (מוחא עילהא סתימאה דעתיקא), and it is the (המו סתרם) [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה]]  mentioned in Etz Chaim, which is the aspect of [[Avira - אוירא]].

And this is the meaning of the good oil, which is the aspect of the inner dimension of the ten sefirot, and the matter of the reasons for the Torah which will be revealed in the future, when there will be a revelation of the aspect of the inner dimension itself.

For now, even the revelation of the inner dimension of the Torah is in the aspect of externality, as it is written in Pri Etz Chaim, that all revelations now are from the aspect of the external dimension of Atik, and in the future, there will be a revelation of the aspect of the inner dimension of Atik, which is the revelation of the aspect of the mind of Atik itself. And this is that the oil floats above the liquids, like the aspect of Atik in the aspect of transcendence and separation itself. And this is what is meant by "like the precious oil... running down upon his measures, which are the garments of [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]]."

For behold, it is known that in the garments of [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]], there are three dimensions: the garments that Moses made, what the wise-hearted made, and it is written "And you shall speak to all of Israel, and they shall make holy garments..." And the garments that Moses made are in the aspect of the garments of Arich itself. For behold, [[Aharon HaKohen - אהרן הכהן|אהרן]], the letters of which spell "seen," is the aspect of the revelation of light, and it is the revelation from the aspect of Arich Anpin, for the attribute of kindness is the aspect of the abundant kindness of Arich itself. And the revelation is through garments, and they are the garments of the commandments, through which is the revelation, as mentioned above. And this refers to the commandments that are performed through the aspect of Arich Anpin, which draw down from the aspect of the crown itself. And as is known regarding the matter of "doing the will of the Omnipresent," it is through the love of "with all your might" itself, as explained elsewhere. And the aspect of the good oil is above the aspect of the aforementioned garments.
