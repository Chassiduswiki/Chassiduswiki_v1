Elsewhere (Eitz Chaim 14:9, principle 5; 27:4), the Arizal explains that the four subdivisions of Ima are as follows:

1. Its chochmah, binah, and da'as are called "the supernal Ima” or “Imma Ila'ah" (אימא עילאה)
2. Its chesed, gevurah, and tiferes are called "the first tevunah."
3. Its netzach, hod, and yesod are called "the second tevunah."
4. Its malchus is called "the third tevunah."

According to this, there is one state of binah and three states of tevunah.

In general, tevunah is "applied intellect," as opposed to binah, which is "abstract intellect." It would thus make sense that binah would only be the chochmah, binah, and da'as of Ima, i.e., the intellect of the intellect, while the other components of the intellect would be its applications to emotion, behavior, and expression.
