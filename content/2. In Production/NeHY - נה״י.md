These three [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] also form a triad known by the acrostic NeHY. Their basic significance and the characteristic of their relationship is that [[Netzach - נצח|Netzach]], [[Hod - הוד|Hod]], and [[Yesod - יסוד|Yesod]] are the receptacles for the three Patriarchs,[^1] — i.e., for [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]], [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]], and [[Tiferes - תפארת|Tiferes]]. In other words, these three "lower" [[Middos - מידות|Middos]] serve as tools, vessels, or channels through which the aforementioned "upper" [[Middos - מידות|Middos]] effect their purpose and factual application.[^2] This does not mean that NeHY are identical with [[ChaGaS - חג''ת|Chaga"s]]: [[Netzach - נצח|Netzach]] is merely a branch and channel of [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]], [[Hod - הוד|Hod]] of [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]], and [[Yesod - יסוד|Yesod]] of [[Tiferes - תפארת|Tiferes]].
