__Mercy, Compassion__

## Etymology

Based on the word "Rechem," womb, linking the emotion fundamentally to the mother; yet we Daven to [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] to have mercy "K'rachem av al banim," As a father would have mercy upon his child. In doing so, we appeal to His "Midas HaRachamim," "Attribute of Mercy."

the Divine attribute which is the source
for and whose function can be compared to this human quality;
the mediating force between the attributes of *[[Chesed - חסד|chesed]] and
*[[Gevurah - גבורה|gevurah]], also identified with *[[Tiferes - תפארת|tiferes]]

Rachamim is the mediating attribute between [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]] and [[Chesed - חסד|Chesed]].
Because the attribute of rachamim is the mediating attribute, it is called [[Tiferes - תפארת|Tiferes]].

#### Rachamim Can Happen for Two Reasons:

1) _רחמים מצד המורגש_ - When one feels someone's pain because he can relate to it.
2) _רחמים מצד רוממות_ - When one feel someone's pain because he's above them. It's human nature that when one is above others and feels safe being above others, there is a tendency to be kinder to those under him.
