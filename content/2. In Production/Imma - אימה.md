In Kabbalah, the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|partzuf]] of "Imma" (or "mother") symbolizes thought, whereas the "daughter" represents the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|partzuf]] of Nukva or [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]]. Imma is the source of [[The Five Gevuros -|The Five Gevuros]], yet these also manifest within Malchus, which is linked to speech, thereby differentiating thought into words. Hence, speech has its roots in thought, establishing both as parallel structures.

Thought encompasses clear and structured ideas within the mind, while speech translates these into articulated words, thus underscoring their similar natures.[^1] [^2]

The maternal figure, Imma, represents thought, while the daughter, [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]], signifies speech.[^3]
Given that speech emanates from thought and maintains a similar framework, the daughter mirrors the mother's characteristics.[^1]
