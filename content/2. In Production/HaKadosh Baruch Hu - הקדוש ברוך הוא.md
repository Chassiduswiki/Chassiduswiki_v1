"HaKadosh Baruch Hu" is a term used to refer to the Creator of the world. This term expresses that the Heiliker Bashefer is beyond all comprehension, as the word "Kadosh" in Lashon Hakodesh means separate and distinct, meaning that we have no comprehension of Him. It is not possible to comprehend the Boireh, since comprehension, no matter how broad and deep, can only encompass and understand one who has limits, and not one who has no limits and is above the concepts that the mind can understand.

In Kabbalah and Chassidus
In Kabbalah, the concept of the Heiliker Bashefer (and in Aramaic) refers to the revelation of the Ribbono Shel Oilam in the worlds through His seven heilike middos, which is known as Ze'ir Anpin, especially when it is mentioned together with the word "Shechinah" which refers to the governance in which the Heiliker Bashefer dwells in His world and is concealed in the [[Levushim - לבושים|levushim]] of the worlds called Biy"a. However, in Chassidus[^1] it is explained that the intention is not specifically for this aspect called Ze'ir Anpin, but for all the worlds above the aspect of the Shechinah which is comprehensible to creations, and more deeply - to the Atzmus.

"Atzmus" is a term used in Sifrei Kabbalah to refer to the Boireh's existence, as it is above all definition, positive or negative. The concept of "Atzmus" refers to the Boireh's essence as it is above **all** human comprehension, with **complete reservation** even from all that is seemingly implied by the term itself (the Boireh's atzmus, etc.), and this term is called "heilik" because it is above our comprehension.

The words "Boruch Hu" are a bracha, based on the posuk "Zecher tzaddik livracha," which Chazal interpreted as referring to Tzidkoi Shel Oilam, that when mentioning the existence of the Boireh, there is an obligation to bentch Him and make Him heilik.
