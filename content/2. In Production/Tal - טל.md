## Definitions

Tal is a watery layer that forms and accumulates mainly throughout the night on objects and surfaces that are outside in the open air, due to the drop in temperature at night, the water vapors in the open air accumulate into droplets. Dew can be found mainly in the early morning hours before the dew evaporates as a result of the sunrise.

#### The Formation of Dew

Throughout the day, the air contains a certain amount of moisture, and when it cools, the amount of moisture it can contain decreases, and as a result, the excess water stops being vapor and turns into tiny water droplets that condense and solidify on nearby objects and surfaces.
Through dew, even plants located in a dry and arid area receive moisture that helps them survive and exist.

### Dew & Rain

Rainfall is inconsistent and Dew falls every morning consistently which shows on its source

### The Source of Tal

	Dew symbolizes a G-dly aspect in the Encompassing Light which is not affected by the Isarusa D'Lisata (Awakening from Below) of the actions of the lower realms, similar to physical dew, which is never withheld and is not at all dependent on human actions. This also explains the fact in Chassidut that the falling of physical dew is specifically at night, at a time when people are sleeping, and there is no Isarusa D'Lisata at all, and this Isarusa D'Leiyla (Awakening from Above) is drawn down specifically in a place of humility and self-nullification, like the darkness of night.
	The source of dew is from the upper three Sefirot of Atik, and it is drawn down to the world through the aspect of [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]], as hinted to by the fact that the initials of "Aglei Tal" (Dew Drops) are "Ata Gibor L'Olam A-" (You are mighty forever, L-rd).
	The Isarusa D'Leiyla of the aspect of "Tal" is what awakens a person to be aroused in Isarusa D'Lisata.
	Through the preparation of a Jew who serves [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]] in the 39 forms of work during the six days of action, he receives a gift from above, the aspect of "Tala D'Nitif MeiAtika" (The dew that drips from Atik).
	Drawing down the aspect of Tal in the worlds is the aspect of "Havaya Echod" (Hashem is One, which equals "Tal" in Gematria), which is drawn down from Keser (the aspect of Alef) to the eighth [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]], the aspect of Yesod ([[Ches -|Ches]]), and then it is the aspect of Dalet Rabbati, which is drawn down internally.

## Tala D'Oriisa

Tal [[Torah - תורה|Torah]] (טל תורה) - "The dew of [[Torah - תורה|Torah]]". This refers to the innermost aspects of the [[Torah - תורה|Torah]].

## Tala D'Nitif MeAtika

Tala D'Nitif MeiAtika (טלא דנטיף מעתיקא) - "The dew that drips from [[Atik Yomin - עתיק יומין|Atik]]". [[Atik Yomin - עתיק יומין|Atik]] refers to the highest level of Godly revelation. This dew is seen as a gift from above.

## Tala D'Bdolcha

Tala D'Vdolcha (טלא דבדולחא) is the aspect of the moisture of [[Mocha Stima'a - מוחא סתימאה|Mocha Stima'a]].
This aspect is above the [[Mazalos -|Mazalos]], and it is the root of the [[Neshamos Yisroel -|Neshamos Yisroel]].

### In Prayers and the Words of the Sages

The Sages define the difference between rain and dew, in that rain depends on human requests and the merits one has, and it is not obligated to fall, whereas dew is never withheld, and they prove this from the story of the prophet. The Sages also say that unlike rain, which can also bring calamity, dew has only blessing, and therefore Isaac our forefather used the language in his blessing: "And may God give you from the dew of the heavens," and they said that dew is a good sign for the world.
Dew is one of the seven liquids which, according to Halacha, when they fall on a food item, it becomes susceptible to ritual impurity, and if it comes into contact with flour, it leavens the dough.
In the Amidah prayer, dew is mentioned throughout the year in the second blessing. During the summer months, only the praise of the falling of dew is mentioned, "He who brings down the dew," and in the winter months, it is mentioned together with the rain, "And bestow dew and rain for blessing."
On the first day of Passover, during the Musaf prayer, when they begin to mention "He who brings down the dew," it is customary for the prayer leader to say the Tal prayer, a prayer with special piyyutim and a request that even though they stop asking for rain, it will be for a blessing and there will be no shortage.

### Tala Oirois Talecha (The Dew of the Lights is Your Dew)

The verse connects dew to the resurrection of the dead: "Your dead will live; My corpses will rise. Awaken and sing, you who dwell in the dust, for Your dew is like the dew of the lights."
Already at the time of the giving of the Torah, when the souls of Israel flew out from the greatness of the divine revelation, the Holy One, Blessed be He, returned their souls to them by means of the "dew with which He is destined to revive the dead." And it is also the Tala D'Oiraisa (Dew of Torah) which is called strength, that when a Jew studies Torah, the Torah revives his soul and gives him the strength to deal with the trials and challenges in the service of Hashem.
More specifically, the aspect of Tal Torah is specifically the innermost aspects of the Torah.
The Rebbe Rayatz expressed that he heard from his father, rabbi from rabbi back to the Alter Rebbe, that the Chassidic stories told at a Chassidic gathering are the aspect of Tala Oirois Talecha, and unlike the rain which sustains the fruits themselves, the dew imparts good taste to the fruits and makes them more nourishing.
