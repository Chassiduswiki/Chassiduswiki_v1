__Father__

## Definitions

A father's relationship can be kinder because it's a little more distant. Av has a stronger connection to [[Rachamim - רחמים|Rachamim]] than Aim does.

In [[Chassidus -]], the father is [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] which is a creative tool. [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] comes up with new ideas and has an intuitive sense of where the truth lies.

It is intuitive and creative because it is connected (it has [[Bittul - ביטול|Bittul]]) to its source, and because it is linked above, it could know things it doesn't know yet.
