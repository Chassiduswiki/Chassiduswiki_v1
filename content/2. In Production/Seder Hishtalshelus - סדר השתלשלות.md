## Etymology

## Definitions

**Seder Hishtalshelus** is a general term for all the stages and levels of the process of [[Tzimtzum - צמצום|Tzimtzum]] of the divine spiritual light. [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] is the highest level in the Seder Hishtalshelus, while this physical world is the lowest level. All the levels in between are included in the "Seder Hishtalshelus."

In Kabbalistic texts, much attention is given to organizing the concepts and clarifying their level in relation to the Seder Hishtalshelus, according to the order of the worlds and the level of divine illumination within them, while establishing clear rules regarding the different levels. The approach of Chassidut differs in that it deals with the fundamental and essential explanation of each aspect and level, without focusing on the reality of the level in relation to the general hierarchy of levels. This is because Chassidus deals with the essence of things, not their externality, and from the perspective of essence, there are no significant differences between the various levels.

## Atzmus Umahus

The term Atzmus Umahus refers to [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] Himself. Atzmus Umahus is not part of the Seder Hishtalshelus because it is independent and not contingent upon any aspect or level; it has no beginning and no end.

However, from Atzmus Umahus, the level of [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] shines and is revealed as a direct consequence. The form of revelation is effortless and does not require any action, similar to the way sunlight naturally illuminates from the sun. The reason for the revelation of light from His Atzmus is that "it arose in His blessed will to create the worlds," and thus, His will was fulfilled, resulting in the creation of the entire Seder Hishtalshelus.

## Ohr Ein Sof

The initial and highest stage in the Seder Hishtalshelus is [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]]. This light shone even before the creation of the worlds, and it is referred to in the verse, "Before the world was created, there was only He and His Name [=His light]." When speaking of [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] as the beginning of the Seder Hishtalshelus, it is important to note that the Ten [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] are also included within it, but only in the form of the [[Esser Sefiros HaGenuzos - ע''ס הגנוזות|Esser Sefiros HaGenuzos]], meaning they exist solely in potential and concealed form. This is because [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] possesses the attributes of true infinity; therefore, it is not divided at all, and there is no room for different [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] within it. In Chassidus, this concept is analogous to a flintstone, where one cannot say that there is fire inside it, but rather that it contains the potential to create fire.

In the level of [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]], there are generally three levels:

1. The highest level is the essence of the light that is not related to anything else and is external. This is [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] as it is included in its source, before it shines and expands.
2. The second level is the expansion and revelation of the light in a way that the light is above being clothed and belonging to the worlds. This level is the root of the [[Ohr Sovev Kol Almin - אור הסובב כל עלמין]].
3. The lowest level is the expansion and revelation of the light in a way that allows for the possibility (in the most subtle way) of the existence of worlds and levels. This level is the root of the [[Ohr Memale Kol Almin - אור הממלא כל עלמין|Ohr Memale Kol Almin]].

At this level, everything is absolutely included in the Creator, and there is no possibility for any other existence besides Him.

## Tzimtzum HaRishon and Ohr HaKav

Since [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] desired that there be contracted worlds in which the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] would not shine, [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] removed the light and left, as it were, an "empty space and void" in which the Atzmus is not discerned and no divine light is seen. This removal is called Tzimtzum HaRishon, and it is the beginning of the descent in the divine light. After the Tzimtzum, [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] continued a limited illumination from the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]], and this illumination is what enables created beings to reveal divinity even within the concealment created by the Tzimtzum.

This form of Tzimtzum is called "Tzimtzum B'Derech Siluk," and it creates a feeling of absolute disconnection from the source, even though the true source still exists (but it is concealed). Regarding this stage in the Seder Hishtalshelus, there was a dispute between the view of the Alter Rebbe and the view of the Vilna Gaon. The Vilna Gaon argued that the divine light indeed withdrew, and in the Seder Hishtalshelus there is no true and essential connection to the Atzmus HaBore, but only to a Reshimu (impression) from it and to the Ohr HaKav. In contrast, the Alter Rebbe argued that the Tzimtzum is not literal, and even within the Seder Hishtalshelus there exists a true and essential connection between every detail and created being to the Atzmus HaBore. This matter is discussed at length in the topic of "Tzimtzum Kipshuto or Tzimtzum Lo Kipshuto."

In the Redemption, the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] will be revealed as it was before this Tzimtzum.

## Olamot Ein Sof

Even after the Tzimtzum HaRishon, light still shines at an extremely high spiritual level that does not allow any room for any entity or real limitation. Therefore, [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] created an order of spiritual worlds, in all of which the Ohr HaKav shines, but in each one it shines less than the previous ones, until the possibility was created for the existence of limited worlds.

This stage in the Seder Hishtalshelus includes infinite worlds, meaning - infinite levels of divinity in which the potential for the creation of infinite worlds is hidden. Sometimes it is called Chai Alfei Almin, but in Likkutei Torah it is explained that the intention is for infinite worlds, but sometimes they speak of a certain way in which this infinity is expressed in the number 18,000 worlds.

The definition of the concept "Olamot Ein Sof" is necessary in the Seder Hishtalshelus, because the purpose of the Hishtalshelus is to create a "world" from "infinity." Therefore, this stage exists, in which on one hand the infinite light of the Creator still shines, and these worlds are not similar to the worlds of Abiya because they do not have a clear definition and division into parts in a revealed way, but nevertheless, the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] exist in them and there is a possibility for division. Through this level and division, the existence of truly limited worlds is made possible.

The most well-known worlds at this level are [[Adam Kadmon - אדם קדמון|Adam Kadmon]], and the worlds of [[Akudim - עקודים|Akudim]], [[Nekudim - נקודים|Nekudim]], and [[Brudim - ברודים|Brudim]].

## Olam HaTohu

Sometimes Olam HaTohu is referred to as part of the Seder Hishtalshelus. In this world, the divine light shines in a way of division into parts and not with infinite power, but the power of the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] is still discernible, in that each attribute possesses a strong power that cannot be nullified at all.

This light is the reason for the [[Sheviras HaKelim -|Sheviras HaKelim]] ([[Sheviras HaKelim -|Shattering of the Vessels]]), and from it descended sparks of the divine light to the continuation of the Seder Hishtalshelus - the worlds of Abiya.

## Olam HaAtzilus

Olam Ha[[Atzilus - אצילות|Atzilus]] is the stage in the Seder Hishtalshelus where a real world already exists, but there are still no real created beings in it, and the feeling in it is "I was only created to serve my Creator," meaning - there is no feeling of independent existence (I was not created), but only a desire and need to fulfill His blessed will. In this world there is no room for [[Kelipa -|Kelipos]] or a sense of self.

Olam Ha[[Atzilus - אצילות|Atzilus]] is an intermediary between the Olamot Ein Sof and the worlds of [[Beriah - בריאה|Beriah]], [[Yetzirah - יצירה|Yetzirah]] , and Asiyah.

## Spiritual Worlds of Beriah, Yetzirah, & Asiyah

These are worlds in which the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] is no longer discernible, but only the fact that they were created by [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]], and even this - not in a direct way. In these worlds there is already a sense of self, as if [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] indeed created beings here. In these worlds there are already angels, [[Kelipa -|Kelipos]], Gan Eden, etc. The common denominator of all the creatures in the worlds of Biya is that they feel that [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] is the one who created them, but they do not feel that they themselves need to be nullified in reality, and they are nullified only in the way of Bittul HaYesh.

## The Physical World of Asiyah

This is the purpose of the entire Seder Hishtalshelus, and the lowest level in it. We live in this world, and in it we must fulfill the purpose for which the entire Seder Hishtalshelus was created - the revelation of the [[Ohr Ein Sof - אור אין סוף|Ohr Ein Sof]] before the Tzimtzum, in all levels. This is also the only world in the Seder Hishtalshelus that is not spiritual but physical.

## The Order of Hishtalshelus of the Sefiros

In a particular way, within the worlds themselves there is also a Seder Hishtalshelus. The beginning of the inner order is in the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]], and its end is in the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]]. Throughout the entire Seder Hishtalshelus, the Ten [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] exist in each world, in different ways. In the higher worlds they are found in a completely potential and hidden way, and in the lower worlds the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] are found in a more defined and revealed way. The Hishtalshelus of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] is also done in the way of cause and effect, where the higher [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] transmits the divine light through it, so that it will pass in a lower way to the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] below it. For example, the light received in the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] is a higher light from [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]], giving an abstract flash of the thing. When the light descends from the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]] to the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Binah - בינה|Binah]], it arrives in a more contracted way, so that it is already possible to grasp the thing and then even detail it into parts. Normally, it is customary to speak of Hishtalshelus in the order of [[Chabad - חב״ד|Chabad]], [[ChaGaS - חג''ת|ChaGaS]], [[NeHY - נה״י|NeHY]], but this is not the only way in which the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] receive from each other. Sometimes the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] receive according to their lines (meaning [[ChaChaN - חח״ן|ChaChaN]], [[BaGaH - בג״ה|BaGaH]], [[DaTY - דת״י|DaTY]]) and in other ways.

The general purpose of the Hishtalshelus of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] is the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]], which is the lowest among the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]], and includes within it in a hidden way all of them. This [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] is the source for the next world in the order of descent, and it includes all the lights and powers from all the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]].

## Malchus & Kesser

After1 the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] receives influence from the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of Yesod in an inner way, it receives the power to realize its unique potential, which is the creation of additional creatures. In each world, the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] of [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] of the world becomes the [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] (meaning, the will and source) for the next world in the Seder Hishtalshelus.

About this it is written:

[[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] of [[Atzilus - אצילות|Atzilus]] becomes [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] for [[Beriah - בריאה|Beriah]]… [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] of [[Beriah - בריאה|Beriah]] becomes [[Kesser - כתר|Kesser]] for [[Yetzirah - יצירה|Yetzirah]]

Through this transition, the connection between the worlds in the Seder Hishtalshelus is created.

## Above Hishtalshelus

"Above Hishtalshelus" is an expression describing the levels of divinity above the worlds that evolve from each other, up to Atzmus Umahus. It is also called the level of "Echad Asar," alluding to it being above the Ten [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] that define the Seder Hishtalshelus.
