Yitzchok's Divine service was characterized by [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]] as indicated by the phrase:[^1]"The Dread of Yitzchok."

And because Yitzchak served G-d through fear and awe, he could not tolerate even a trace of evil in his environment. For this reason, he became blind, unable to witness the incense being offered by [[Esav -|Esav]]'s idolatrous Canaanite wives.[^2] [^3]
