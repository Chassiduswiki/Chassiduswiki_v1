Types of Neshamos Yisroel: Zera Adam, Zera Behema

Zera Adam

- Neshamos of Atzilus (Even in the past were few)

- In Atzilus, the Bitul level is Bitul b'Metizus. Meaning, knowing a concept intellectually impels it to become the reality as a result of Da'at.

- Adam is gematria Mah (45)

Zera Behema

- Neshamos of Biyah (Definition: Neshamos without Da'at. Most of today's neshamos)

- As part of Biyah, the Bitul level is Bitul HaYesh. Meaning, even knowing intellectually the concept doesn't translate into a true sense, as a result of lack of Da'at.

- Malachim are called Chayos and Behemas due to their lack of Da'at. For the same reason, they have Bitul HaYesh.
