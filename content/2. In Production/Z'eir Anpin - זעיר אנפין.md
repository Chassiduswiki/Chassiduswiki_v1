## Definitions

**Zeir Anpin** is the name of the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]] formed from the integration of the Middos of the world of Atzilus. Zeir Anpin, together with [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] d'Atzilus, are also referred to as 'Kudsha Brich Hu u'Shechintei'. The Yichud created between them is called Yichuda Tata'ah. Therefore, the [[Mitzvos -|mitzvos]] that we perform are directed towards the unification of **Zeir Anpin** with the [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] d'Atzilus. Many have the custom to recite a formula of "L'shem Yichud" before performing [[Mitzvos -|mitzvos]], for example: "L'shem Yichud Kudsha Brich Hu u'Shechintei".

Additionally, Zeir Anpin shines greatly on the day of Shabbos, and in the Mussaf prayer of Shabbos, it ascends to the place of Abba and Imma, which is a very high level of kedushah, and from there, the Zeir Anpin and [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] draw from [[Atika Kadisha - עתיקא קדישא|Atika Kadisha]] (just as every world draws from the light of the world above it, and Abba and Imma always draw from [[Atika Kadisha - עתיקא קדישא|Atika Kadisha]]). Therefore, the morning meal of Shabbos is called "Seudah d'Atika Kadisha". In the third meal, it ascends to an even higher level, the highest level of Yom Kippur, and then Zeir Anpin itself reaches the level of [[Atika Kadisha - עתיקא קדישא|Atika Kadisha]]. However, this ascent is only for Zeir Anpin, and since the ascent of Zeir Anpin to [[Atika Kadisha - עתיקא קדישא|Atika Kadisha]] is an intrinsic ascent - it itself receives the powers of [[Atika Kadisha - עתיקא קדישא|Atika Kadisha]], which are called Re'uta d'Re'uin, and therefore this meal is emphasized by its name "Seudasa d'Zeir Anpin".[^1]

## Its Inyan

Zeir Anpin is the [[Partzuf - פרצוף|Partzuf]] formed from the integration of the six Middos, and specifically refers to the Zeir Anpin of the world of Atzilus. Its inyan is that it is the revelation of [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaKadosh Baruch Hu]] in a revealed manner. In this, it differs from Abba Ila'ah and Imma Ila'ah of the world of Atzilus, which are in the aspect of Alma d'Iskasya and do not come in a revealed manner. It also differs from [[Malchus - מלכות|Malchus]] d'Atzilus, which is the aspect of the Shechinah, the chiyus that dwells within the worlds and within Klal Yisrael.

Zeir Anpin is also called 'Adam'. It is explained that it is in the aspect of 'Ramach Eivarin d'Malka', which means it is in the aspect of 248 limbs in which the Ohr Ein Sof dwells. The concept of these 248 limbs is that Zeir Anpin is composed of nine Sefiros, and each of these Sefiros includes the other nine Sefiros. All these particular Sefiros are in the aspect of Rosh, Toch, Sof, totaling 243, and with the addition of the five Chassadim that enlarge it, it is in the aspect of 248, and these are the Ramach Eivarin d'Malka.

## In relation to Arich Anpin

The source of pleasures in the externality of the Keser of the world of Atzilus is called Arich Anpin (long face), and its inyan is that it extends at great length. Arich Anpin is the source of Zeir Anpin (small face). Zeir Anpin is of small quantity and in the aspect of brevity in its very existence, in relation to Arich Anpin. An analogy for this is the emotions of the heart of a person, which are in the aspect of brevity in their very existence in relation to their root in pleasure.

An analogy for the difference between Zeir Anpin and Arich Anpin:[^2] It is like a map of a geographical area compared to the area itself. For example, a real river compared to its marking on a map. Or the dimensions of a small child compared to the dimensions of an adult.
