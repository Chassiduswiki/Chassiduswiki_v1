## Definitions

Aspaklaria is a transparent glass, sometimes polished as a lens for eyeglasses (or a magnifying glass), and sometimes used as a mirror.

A matter that arises from the "[[Sheviras HaKelim -|Shattering of the Vessels]]" is the concept of good and evil. Good means that G-dliness is revealed, evil means that G-dliness is concealed.

In other words, when the allegory is connected to that which is being allegorized, it is good, for it is one with its source.

However, when the allegory is separate from its source, it is evil, because it becomes a separate entity, with a sense of itself, separate and apart from [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaShem]], the Singular Preexistent Intrinsic Being. This sense of self, as a being separate and apart from [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|HaShem]], is the source of all evil, and in essence, is the belief in dualism and the preexistence of multiplicity, which is tantamount to idolatry.

### Aspakelaria HaMe'irah

Like a magnifying glass which magnifies the light.

The translation of _Aspaklaria Hame'era_ as a magnifying glass is taken from _Sefer HaLikkutim Tzemach Tzedek,_ Vol. Aleph p. 1370.

### Aspaklaria Shelo Me'irah

like a mirror, in which one can only see his own
reflection.

This is an example of 'aspaklaria she'aino me'erah,' meaning that while it appears to reflect the exact form of the object without any change, it is only the image of the thing and not its essence.[^1]
