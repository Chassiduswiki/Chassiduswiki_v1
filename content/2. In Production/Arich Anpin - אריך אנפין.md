## Definitions

Arich Anpin (also called Arich Stam) is the externality of the Keser and its lower part. The 'Keser' is the "intermediary" and the "bridge" between the Ohr Ein Sof (called "Ma'atzil") and the world of Atzilus (called "Ne'etzalim"), and through it, to the other worlds. Like any intermediary, it comprises the two aspects it connects: its inner dimension is the lower level of the Ma'atzil, which is the Ohr Ein Sof (called Atik Yomin), and its external dimension is the upper level of the Ne'etzalim, meaning the worlds that were created after the Tzimtzum of the Divine light (called Arich Anpin).[^1]

### Ratzon for the Existence of the Worlds

Arich Anpin is the will for the worlds to exist.[^2] And since the main aspect of the worlds are the seven [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]],[^3] therefore the root of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] as they are in Arich Anpin is also in the number seven.[^4]

### Source of the Ne'etzalim

Arich Anpin is the "upper level of the Ne'etzalim", meaning it is the root of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]]: the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] themselves derive their vitality from the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of the world of Atzilus, and the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of the world of Atzilus have their root in the Keser, and in the Keser itself from the lower and external level in it - in Arich Anpin. Chassidus brings two analogies for the difference between the Middos of Atzilus and their root in Arich:

1. Revealed Flame vs. Fire Within the Ember
	1. The difference between the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] and their root: The fire within the ember is truly united with the ember, and it has no prior "cause" apart from the ember itself. In contrast, the fire upon the ember stems (not directly) from the ember itself but from the fire within it.[^5]
	2. The existence of the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] from their root: When looking at the ember, it is not at all apparent that there is fire within it, but when bringing straw close to it or blowing on it, a flame emerges. This concealment is called "the concealment close to revelation", and this is the relationship between the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] as they are in their root in Arich to their existence in Atzilus.
2. Written Letters vs. Engraved Letters
	1. Just as engraved letters are one with the precious stone they are engraved in, as opposed to written letters which are something else (the ink is made from vegetation, and the parchment from animals), so too the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] as they are in their root are utterly united with Divinity, but as they are in Atzilus they are in the aspect of "vessels" that limit the light enclothed in them.[^6]

### Enclothement of Arich Anpin in Chochmah and Binah

Av"a stands for "Abba ve'Imma", which are Chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]] of Atzilus.[^7] The meaning of the "saying" is that the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of Arich Anpin (its seven lower [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]]) are literally enclothed in Chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]] of Atzilus, meaning, what Chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]] receive from the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of Arich is in a way of literal enclothement and closeness. This is not the case with what they (Chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]]) receive from higher levels[^8] from which they only "yenika" (suckle) - which is in a way of distance.[^9]

The meaning of this "enclothement" is that Chessed of Arich (enclothed in Chochmah) is the root of the entire right line (Chach"an - Chochmah, Chessed, [[Netzach - נצח|Netzach]]), while [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]] of Arich (enclothed in [[Binah - בינה|Binah]]) is the root of the entire left line (Beg"ah - [[Binah - בינה|Binah]], [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]], Hod).

### Influence of Arich Anpin on the Middos

Unlike Chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|Binah]] (in which Arich Anpin is "enclothed" internally), it influences the Middos only in an external way. The source for this matter is what is stated in Eitz Chaim[^10] that a strand of hair of Arich Anpin strikes the back of Ze'eir Anpin, and through this the [[Da'as - דעת|Da'as]] of Ze'eir Anpin distributes to Chessed and [[Gevurah - גבורה|Gevurah]]. Meaning, the influence of Arich Anpin on Ze'eir Anpin (the Middos) is in a way of "back" (and in Kabbalistic terminology it is called "Yichud Anchor be'Achor").

Chassidus explains this through an analogy from the human soul ("From my flesh I perceive G-dliness"):[^11] In the human soul, "Arich Anpin" is the level of "ratzon" (will) and "Ze'eir Anpin" are the Middos (love and fear of [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]]). In order for the "natural" love and fear (with which a person is born) to grow, and for "intellectual" love and fear to be born in him, there is a need for a provision of power that is above intellect. Meaning, a person has the power to arouse in himself love and fear that are higher than they are for him naturally, even without studying and delving and having what to contemplate - and this is with the power of the "ratzon" engraved in the depth of his soul (the level of "Arich Anpin" within him). This arousal is the preface that gives him the power and the ability to reach intellectual love and fear in an inner and true way.


### Circles of Arich

The [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of Arich Anpin differ in their essence and forms from the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] of Atzilus. The light of Atzilus is "memale",[^12] and comes in the form of "yosher" (the level of each [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefirah]] is lower than the one that "gave birth" to it, and therefore they are depicted in a straight line one beneath the other). In contrast, the light of Arich Anpin is "sovev",[^13] and comes in the form of "circles".[^14]

The meaning of this is that on one hand, "Arich Anpin" includes and encompasses at once the entire order of hishtalshelus (worlds of Atzilus Beriah Yetzirah Asiyah) from their head to their feet, but on the other hand it is only a "ratzon" for the existence - and is not a root and source for the actual existence.

This is similar to human will. When a person wants to build a house (for example): on one hand his will encompasses the entire form of the house, the floors in it, the form and size of the rooms, the furniture he wants in it, etc. But on the other hand, the will itself cannot actually build a house… For this, there is a need for chochmah and [[Binah - בינה|binah]], middos and action.

### Its Aspect in the Human Soul

Just as in the worlds the matter of Arich Anpin is the will for the existence of the worlds (as above), so too in the soul it is the level of will. In the soul there are "encompassing" and "internal" powers, and will is one of the encompassing powers.

Explanation: The internal powers[^15] are limited to a specific limb,[^16] but will is not so, rather it is found equally in all the limbs. This is perceptible, for as soon as a will arises in a person to move his hand, it moves immediately without any delay at all (meaning, it is perceptibly evident that the will does not need to travel from the head to the hand, and the reason for this is because the will is found simultaneously in the head and the hand equally).

[^4]: And Mocha Stimah is only for the vitality of the worlds and not for their essential existence, and so it is in the worlds themselves. This can be understood by analogy from the soul's powers: the essential person is the emotions, and the intellect is generally only in service of them. As is known, when a person points to himself as "I", he does not point at his head but at his chest - the dwelling place of the middos.

[^8]: Chochmah Stimah and above it.
[^9]: For "yenika" is like the way an infant suckles, that its body and soul are not from its mother (and only that the milk nourishes it), but "enclothement" is like the way the soul animates the body - it is its very life-force.

[^13]: Light that does not enclothe in vessels and is not felt in them, like how the foot, hand and even higher limbs like the ear and eye do not feel and are not aware of the person's will.
[^14]: Meaning, the [[Sefiros - ספירות|Sefiros]] are not one beneath the other but one around the other - like a circle within a circle.
[^15]: Which are intellect and emotion, as well as senses, lifeforce of the limbs, thought speech and action.
