__Attachment, Devotion__

Dveykus, or cleaving, is a term used to describe a deep connection and union with [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא]].

Dveykus is linked to [[Mochin - מוחין|Mochin]]
The attachment between a person and their intellect is such that the person becomes "attached" נדבק to their knowledge. As if they and their knowledge are one thing (since their knowledge is their understanding, their reality is therefore attached to their knowledge).

When in a state of Dveykus, there is no I; you're just a representative of the divine and have no ideas of your own. Dveykus is passive

Dveykus represents a state of connection and union with [[HaKadosh Baruch Hu - הקדוש ברוך הוא|Hashem]], while [[Bittul - ביטול|Bittul]] represents the process of letting go of the self to achieve that connection.
