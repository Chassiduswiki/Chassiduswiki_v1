## Definitions

In Kabala we find two concepts of the name Yisrael. One is called the Old Yisrael, or Yisrael Saba, and the second is called the small Yisrael, or Yisrael Zuta. Yisrael Saba refers to the level of Nehiy of Chochma of [[Atzilus - אצילות]] as it descends into the Midos. In other words, it is the level of of Midos that are found within Chochma. This is because the term Yisrael refers to Chochma, as Yisrael is a make up of two words, Yisra Keil, anmd the name Keil refers to [[Chochmah - חכמה|Chochmah]]. Saba refers to light and hence Yisrael Saba means the light of Chochma as it shines in the Midos. On the other hand, Yisrael Zuta refers to the level of Chochma found in the Midos itself. This level of Chochma does not derive from Chochma of [[Atzilus - אצילות]] but is rather completely incorporated from within the Midos of Z"a.
